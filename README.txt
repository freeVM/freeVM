======================================
         Apache Harmony DRLVM
======================================

DRLVM is one of the virtual machines of the Apache Harmony 
project. It contains: 
 
    - VM (VM Core)
    - GC
    - JIT
    - Bytecode Verifier 
    - Class Libraries (Kernel Classes only)
    - OS Layer

See http://wiki.apache.org/harmony for a definition of these components.

At the time of original initial donation it could do the following with
Harmony classes:

    - Run Eclipse, version 3.1.1: create, edit, compile, and launch Java* applications
    - Provide a self-hosting development environment: the JRE can build itself
 
The supported configurations are Windows* IA-32 and Linux* IA-32.

You can now run DRLVM on the command line or under Eclipse*. For details on 
how to run the VM under Eclipse*, see Getting Started with DRLVM, 
[http://incubator.apache.org/harmony/subcomponents/drlvm/getting_started.html].  

 3.1 Build the selected components. 
     
      You can build any component indicated in the file
     ./build/make/deploy.xml.
    
 3.2 Clean up the previously built code by executing one of the following:
    
      On  Windows*:     | On Linux*:
      ------------------+---------------
      build.bat clean   | build.sh clean 
 
 3.3 Update the network resources as required. 
    
      The build uses external resources from a network, such as APR or Harmony classes.
      These are downloaded and stored locally during the first launch of the build. 

      3.3.1 Change the resource location settings by editing the property file:
       
             On  Windows*:            | On Linux*:
            --------------------------+--------------------------
            build\make\win.properties | build/make/lnx.properties              

            Example:
            The build searches for the Eclipse* archive in its default location on the web:
            remote.ECLIPSE.archieve=http://eclipse.objectweb.org/downloads/drops/R-3.1.1-200509290840/eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-win32.zip
            You can specify the Eclipse* installation directory by setting the ECLIPSE_HOME 
            environment variable.  
       
      3.3.2 Update the local version of external resources.
    
            To download a fresh copy of the external resources, type the following:

      
            On Windows*:        | On Linux*:
            --------------------+----------------
            build.bat update    | build.sh update
     
            External resources are stored in the directory:
      
            build/pre-copied
      
      
 3.4 Clean up the local copy of the external resources by executing the following:
      
     On Windows*:             | On Linux*:
     -------------------------+----------------------
     build.bat clean.update   | build.sh clean.update
              
     NOTE: Because you have executed the target 'update' previously, 
     this ./build.sh  takes the locally stored resources for building. 

4. RUNNING DRLVM WITH EXTERNAL CLASS LIBRARIES
----------------------------------------------
 
To run DRLVM with third-party external class libraries, do the following:

1. Check that these class libraries comply with the kernel classes interface 
   and the VMI interfaces, see the description in the directory
   <EXTRACT_DIR>/Harmony/vm/vmcore/src/kernel_classes. 

2. Add external native dynamic libraries (*.dll or *.so files) to the system path or copy 
   the files into the <EXTRACT_DIR>/deploy/jre/bin directory. 

3. Add external library class directories or .jar files into the -Xbootclasspath option. 

   Example:
   ij -Xbootclasspath/p:c:\external_library\lib\classes.jar MyApp
 

5. BUILDING AND RUNNING TESTS
-----------------------------

To build and run the DRLVM tests, execute the following command:

   On Windows*:    |  On Linux*:
   ----------------+----------------
   build.bat test  |  build.sh test


The test classes are placed in
<EXTRACT_DIR>/Harmony/make/%BUILD_CFG%_Windows_ia32_%NATIVE_COMPILER%/semis/vm/test/classes.
The test results are placed in
<EXTRACT_DIR>/Harmony/make/%BUILD_CFG%_Windows_ia32_%NATIVE_COMPILER%/semis/vm/test/report.
