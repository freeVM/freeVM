Here's how to edit and publish the website.  Note 
that this assumes you have a working implementation 
of Java and Ant installed.


1) Edit the docs in xdocs/

2) Type "ant" in the root (site/)

3) Look at the changes in the docs/ directory using
   a web browser.

4) Repeat steps 2-4 until happiness and joy achieved.

5) Commit all changes, both docs/ and xdocs/
   
    svn commit

6) ssh to minotaur

7) cd /www/incubator.apache.org/harmony

8) execute 
    
     `cat UPDATE` 

   to update the just-committed docs out of SVN

9) Verify that all went as planned by browsing the live 
    site 

      http://incubator.apache.org/harmony/

    and look for the changes you made.  Note that it may take up
    to an hour after step (8) is complete before the changes are
    reflected on the live website.
