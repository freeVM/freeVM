2013 Adaptive Alchemy, LLC
==========================================================================

DONE:

We have converted over the SVN repo to GIT, but
we have not built the project as of yet. So

TODO;

Update 10/23/2013

Building
--------

1. We need to build the master branch of the HRE/HDK
   on a modern platform.  I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit,
   but any modern version of Linux should be fine.
   If you want to try to build under Windows, that's
   great too.
   
2. We need to perform some basic tests and get an idea
   of the current condition of the project and what
   work needs to be done to stabilize the project and
   bring it as much as possible into compatibility
   with Java 6.
   
Documentation
-------------

1. Document build prerequisites and how to install them.
2. Document the build process.
3. Document the repository directories.
