UPDATE TO HARMONY SOURCES FOR INTEL DRLVM CONTRIBUTION
          March 30, 2006
======================================

This archive contains patches for the Apache Harmony class libraries:
  - Small patch for the class library com.ibm.oti.vm.MsgHelp
    The setLocale() method has been accommodated to work with the null class loader.
  - Patch for java/net/URLClassLoader.java to correctly process whitespaces 
    in classpath.
  - Patch for the org.apache.harmony.eclipse.jdt.launching plugin 
    The new functionality enables Eclipse* to recognize Intel DRLVM.
