/* This file describes LIL - the architecture-independent language used to generate code stubs etc.

Goals:
* Lightweight - i.e. small language, quality code generation possible with small simple algorithms
* Remove most architecture dependencies from code
* (Future) allow inlining of VM stubs into JITed code
* (Future) allow inlining of GC or Thread/Sync code via LIL
* (Possibly future) be the lowest ir of a simple JIT

Design constaints:
* Keep language syntax LL(1) so that parsing can be done with a recursive descent parser
* Make single-pass register allocation possible
* Allow easy experimentation with calling conventions

The basic unit of LIL is a code stub.  It is intended to be the entry point of a function that can be
called by managed or native code, and executes in the presence of an activation frame.  The frame consists
of up to six parts: inputs, standard places, an m2n frame, locals, outputs, and a return variable.  Which
parts are present in the activation frame, and how big each part is, can vary across points in the code stub.

A LIL code stub is an entry and a sequence of statements.  The entry specifies the inputs and their types, the
number of standard places, the type of the return, and the calling convention (which determines where the inputs,
return address, and return goes, which registers are caller save vs callee save, and who pops the inputs; standard
places are determined by LIL and the platform, and are intended for trampolines).  An entry can have an "arbitrary"
signature, meaning that the number and type of inputs and type of return is unknown (the stub must work for all
possibilities).  After entry the declared number
of input variables are available, the declared number of standard places are available, there is no m2n frame,
there are no locals, there are no outputs, and there is no return variable.

cs ::= entry i:cc:sig; ss
ss ::= s | s ss

The statements are:

s ::= :l;
|  locals i;
|  std_places i;
|  alloc v,i;
|  v=uop o;
|  v=o op o;
|  v=o;
|  v=ts;
|  handles=o;
|  ld v,addr(,zx|,sx)?;
|  st addr,o;
|  inc addr;
|  cas addr=o,o,l;
|  j l;
|  jc cond,l;
|  out cc:sig;
|  in2out cc:RT;
|  calli o;
|  ret;
|  push_m2n i oh;
|  m2n_save_all;
|  pop_m2n;
|  print str, o;

uop ::= neg | not | sx1 | sx2 | sx4 | zx1 | zx2 | zx4 | ...
op ::= + | - | * | & | << | ...

addr ::= [ov osv i :T ackrel]
ov ::= | v+
osv ::= | 1*v+ | 2*v+ | 4*v+ | 8*v+
acqrel ::= | ,acquire | ,release

cond ::= v=0 | v!=0 | o=o | o!=o | o<o | o<=o | o<u o | o<=u o | ...

calli ::= call | call.noret | tailcall
oh ::= | , handles

o ::= (v | i) (:t)?

cc ::= platform | jni | managed | rth | stdcall
platform = default calling convention used by VM
jni      = calling convention used by JNI
managed  = calling convention used by jitted code
rth      = calling convention used to call runtime helpers
stdcall  = Windows's stdcall calling convention

20021204: The rth calling convention should be used for all runtime helpers.  Unfortunately, on IA32 we are inconsistent in the calling
             conventions used to call runtime helpers - some use stdcall, some use the managed code conventions.  So for now, rth is to be
             used for stdcall helpers, managed should be used for the rest.  In the future we can harmonise this and correct the problem.

l is a label (sequence of alpha, digit, _, starting with alpha or _)
v is a variable, one of: i0, i1, ... (input variables), sp0, sp1, ... (standard places), l0, l1, ... (local variables),
o0, o1, ... (output variables), r (return variable)
i is an immediate (sequence of digits, or 0x hex digits)
str is either a string enclosed in single quotes, or a number denoting an address

Operand semantics:

An operand with a v stands for that variable; an operand with an i stands for that immediate; an operand with an optional :t is cast to the
type t (ie it has type t).  Only certain casts are allowed by the verifier: the types ref, pint, and g4/g8 (depending upon architecture) are
castable to each other.  Note that casting refs to/from the other types may be GC unsafe.

Statement semantics:

:l declares a label l.  A LIL code stub is not valid if such a label merges control flow with inconsistent
activation frames.  Specifically, the number and types of inputs must be the same (currently there is no way they
could not be), only the minimum of the number of standard places will be available after the statement, the m2n frame
must either be present in all incoming edges or absent in all incoming edges, the number of locals must be the same, the
number of outputs must be the same, and
the return variable will be defined after the statement only if it is defined on all incoming edges.

locals i makes i locals available in the activation frame.  If there were locals available previously, they are lost.

std_places i makes i standard places available in the activation frame.  If there were standard places available previously,
they are lost.

alloc v, i allocates i contigous bytes of space whose lifetime is up to the next ret, tailcall, or pop_m2n instruction.
The address of this
space is placed into v.  The space will not be moved for any reason.  The amount of space allocated by such instructions must
be statically determinable for each code point in a code stub.  This instruction may not appear between out/in2out and
call/call.noret/tailcall instructions.

v=uop o evaluates o to a value, performs unary operation uop on it, and stores the result in v.

v=o1 op o2 evaluates o1 & o2 to values, performs binary operation op on them, and stores the result in v.

v=ts places a pointer to the current thread's thread structure into v.

handles=o evaluates o to a value and sets the handles pointer in the m2n frame to this value.  This instruction must be
dominated by a push_m2n handles instruction.

ld v,addr evaluates addr to an address (see below) and loads the value (of type given in addr) at this address into v.  If ,zx appears
at the end then the value is zero extended into v, which gets type pint; if ,sx appears at the end then the value is sign extended into v,
which gets pint; otherwise, v gets the same type as in addr.

st addr,o evaluates addr to an address (see below) o to a value and stores the value into the contents (of type given in addr) at the address.

inc addr evaluates addr to an address (ses below) and increments the value (of type given in addr) at this address.

cas addr=o1,o2,l evaluates addr to an address (see below) a, o1 to a value v1, and o2 to a value v2.  Then it atomically: compares
the value (of type gien in addr) to o1 and if equal swaps the contents of a with o2.  If the match fails then it jumps to label l.

ov+osv+i:T acqrel evaluates to (0 | contents of v) + (0 | 1 * contents of v | 2 * contents of v | 4 * contents of v |
8 * contents of v) + i.  Further if acqrel is acquire then the operation in which it appears has acquire semantics, and if
it is release then the operation in which it appears has release semantics.

j l jumps to label l.  A LIL code stub is invalid if l is not a declared label in the code stub.

jc cond, l either continues with the next statement or jumps to label l, depending upon the evaluation of cond.  A LIL
code stub is invalid if l is not declared in the stub.  The conditions are evaluated as follows.  v=0 will branch if v
has value 0; v!=0 will branch if v does not have value 0; o1=o2 will branch if o1 & o2 evaluate to the same value; o1!=o2
will branch if o1 & o2 evaluate to different values; o1<o2 will branch if o1 evaluates to a value signed less than what
o2 evaluates to; o1<=o2 will branch if o1 evaluates to a value signed less than or equal what
o2 evaluates to; o1<u o2 will branch if o1 evaluates to a value unsigned less than what
o2 evaluates to; o1<=u o2 will branch if o1 evaluates to a value unsigned less than or equal what
o2 evaluates to.

out cc:Ts:RT sets up in the activation frame the given number of outputs with the given types, cc says what calling
convention will be used, and RT declares the return type.  This statement preserves the inputs, standard places, locals,
return, alloced memory, and m2n frame, but destroys the outputs.

in2out cc:RT sets up outputs equal in number and type to the inputs, copies the inputs to the outputs, cc says what calling
convention will be used, and maybe different from the code stub's calling convention; the return type is given by RT.
This statement preserves the inputs, standard places, locals, return, and m2n frame, but redefines the outputs.  An in2out
is not allowed if the entry signature is arbitrary.

call o evaluates o to an address and calls it.  A LIL code stub is invalid unless call o is dominated by an out statement
or is dominated by an in2out statement.  The calling convention declared in the dominating statement is used for this call.
This statement preserves inputs, locals, alloced memory, and the m2n frame, but destroys the standard places, outputs, and
redefines the return to be the value returned from the call.

call.noret o is similar to call o, but the LIL write is asserting the the function never returns.  The LIL code generator
is free to not generate code to deal with the function returning.

tailcall o is equivalent to in2out cc:RT;call o;ret; where cc is the code stub's calling convention and RT is the code stub's
return type, except that the LIL code generator might optimise it, and the entry signature may be arbitrary.

ret returns from the code stub.  A LIL code stub is invalid if the return is not defined and the return type of the code stub
is not void, or if there is an m2n frame.  The calling convention of the code stub determines how the return is done.  A return
will automatically free locals, outputs, memory allocated by alloc, and standard places.  A return is not allowed if the entry
signature is arbitrary.

push_m2n i,h adds an m2n frame to the activation frame.  A LIL code stub is invalid if there is already an m2n frame or if an
alloc could be performed before push_m2n.  This instruction preserves inputs, standard places, and locals, but destroys outputs
and the return.  The optional handles keyword specifies if the m2n frame will have handles or not.  The i parameter specifies the
method associated with the M2nFrame (or 0 for no association).

m2n_save_all saves all callee saves registers in the m2n frame.  On some architectures not all such registers are saved on a push m2n,
just the ones that are relevant to most m2n operations.  See the M2n module for details.  This statement must be dominated by a push_m2n
and it preserves the context.

pop_m2n removes the m2n frame from the activation frame.  This statement must be dominated by a push_m2n instruction and with a
consistent handles declaration.  If handles is declared then pop_m2n will free all handles attached to this m2n frame.  The instruction
preserves inputs, locals, and the return, but destorys standard places, alloc-ed memory, and the outputs.

print outputs a message to the screen in debug mode, and does nothing in
release mode.  Its two arguments will be passed to a printf-like function,
with the usual semantics.

A LIL code stub is invalid if it does not end in a terminal instruction, that is, a ret, j, call.noret, or tailcall.

The types are:

T ::= g1 | g2 | g4 | g8 | f4 | f8 | ref | pint
RT ::= T | void

sig ::= Ts:RT | arbitrary
Ts ::= | T,Ts

The meaning of the types is: g1 means a one-byte general-purpose (ie not floating point) quantitiy, g2 means two-byte, g4
means 4-bytes, g8 menas eight-byte, f4 means a 4-byte floating-point quantity, f8 means 8-byte, ref means a pointer into the
managed heap, pint means a platform-sized general-purpose
quantity which might be an integer or an unmanaged pointer, void means there is nothing returned.

The LIL syntax allows comments that start with // and go to the end of the line.
