//
//  Event objects can be used for debugging purposes as well as to contain the
//  amount of optimizations done to put bounds on compile time/space, etc.
//  For debugging the client would create an event object and associate it with 
//  optimization being debugged. On each optimization step the event would be
//  incremented. The client would cease to apply the optimization once the
//  associated event overflows. With this we can do a binary search to find the
//  minimum number of optimization steps needed to cause a failure. Then we can
//  generate a "good" and "bad" compilation output that are very close to each 
//  other thereby enabling easy debug.
