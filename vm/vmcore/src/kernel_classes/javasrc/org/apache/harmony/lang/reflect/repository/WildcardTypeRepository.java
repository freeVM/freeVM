/**
 * (This all should be considered as an experimental approach which could be changed on
 * java.lang.ref using)
 * 
 * WildcardTypeRepository keeps iformation about wild cards.
 * 
 * For now the following approach for keeping is realized.
 * A concreet WC instance is included into repository if somebody do the *first* request for
 * the reflect's method like Class.getGenericSuperclass()->Class.ReflectionData.initGenericSuperclass()
 * (Field.getGenericType()->Field.FieldData.initGenericType()
 *  Method.getGenericReturnType()->Class.MethodData.initGenericReturnType()
 *  ...
 *  Constructor.getGenericParameterTypes()->Class.ConstructorData.initGenericParameterTypes()
 *  ...
 * ) and there are ParameterizedTypes with wild cards.
 * The wild card creation and allocation within repository is located within AuxiliaryCreator.createTypeArg method.
 * If the identical WC is accessed anyhow then the pointer from repository is used. However,
 * further it can be removed from the repository if the cache is full under the new instance including.
 * Then if reflect's request for such WC using the earlier used interface methods then the pointers
 * to such instance kept within the Method/Constructor/Field/Class instances are returned just if it is
 * absent within repository. But if we access anyhow to some instance of the same WC type which has 
 * been removed from repository then the new exemplar of instance is created and included into 
 * repository and the pointer to it is replicated if it needs.
 * 
 * Maybe, it would be more convinient to realize another repository implementation
 * where the accumulative approach will be used.
 * 
 * Note1. The inserted on 01.27.06 cache3 may significantly slow the algorithm but
 * it needs to provide the functional completeness of repository because we should distinguish
 * the entries with equals signatures if there are TVARs which are only homonym ones, i.e.
 * they are parameters of different generic declarations.

     * which can't be copied any more only recreated (as equal, of course). If the cache has an entity which
     * the reflect supporting algorithm supposes to include there than the cache's algorithm copies the existing entity.
     * If the cache is not full and an entity does not exist than there the cache's algorithm
     * creates preliminary an entity and inserts it there.
     * So, an earlier created type variable exists while the cache's algorithm has pointer[s] of it
     * within the cache (entity has not removed yet during cleanings)
     * or user's java code keeps pointer[s] of this type variable.
