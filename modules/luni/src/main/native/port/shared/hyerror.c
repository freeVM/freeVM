/**
 * @file 
 * @ingroup Port
 * @brief Error Handling
 *
 * If an OS system call fails the error code reported by the OS needs to be saved for future reference.
 * The OS error code as well as the corresponding portable error code are stored in the per thread
 * buffers @ref hyportptb.h via a call the @ref hyerror_set_last_error or @ref hyerror_set_last_error_with_message.
 * These functions are meant for private use by the port library, to set the error related to a system call failure.
 * They are in the port library table as people overriding port library functions may need to set the error
 * message accordingly.
 *
 * The majority of applications are not interested in the human readable error message corresponding to
 * the error.  As a result the error message is not stored at time of the reported error, but can be looked
 * up at a later time.
