Pending improvements:
 
BigInteger:
* BigInteger.multiply: test to find out the threshold between the karatsuba and 
  the paper and pencil multiplication methods. The Paper and Pencil algorithm 
  should be optimized.

* BigInteger.modPow: Find an efficienter algorithm to odd numbers.

* BigInteger(int,int,Random): to implement a better algorithm to chose a random 
  prime number; and not simply to generate a number and test if it's prime.


BigDecimal:
* divide(BigDecimal divisor, int scale, RoundingMode roundingMode):
  could be improved. One possibility is to avoid using power of ten when it 
  isn't necessary or return pre-calculated results for particular types of 
  rounding and certain arguments.


* (String Conversion): to think if it's convenient to cache the String 
  representation of the BigInteger unscaled value to avoid processing a heavy 
  conversion in each call to some of the string conversion methods.

MathContext:
* All works wonderfull


RoundingMode:
* All works wonderfull
