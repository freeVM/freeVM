/**
 * This class must be implemented by the VM vendor. The documented natives must
 * be implemented to support other provided class implementations in this
 * package. An instance of class Class is the in-image representation of a Java
 * class. There are three basic types of Classes
 * <dl>
 * <dt><em>Classes representing object types (classes or interfaces)</em>
 * </dt>
 * <dd>These are Classes which represent the class of a simple instance as
 * found in the class hierarchy. The name of one of these Classes is simply the
 * fully qualified class name of the class or interface that it represents. Its
 * <em>signature</em> is the letter "L", followed by its name, followed by a
 * semi-colon (";").</dd>
 * <dt><em>Classes representing base types</em></dt>
 * <dd>These Classes represent the standard Java base types. Although it is not
 * possible to create new instances of these Classes, they are still useful for
 * providing reflection information, and as the component type of array classes.
 * There is one of these Classes for each base type, and their signatures are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>B</code> representing the <code>byte</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>S</code> representing the <code>short</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>I</code> representing the <code>int</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>J</code> representing the <code>long</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>F</code> representing the <code>float</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>D</code> representing the <code>double</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>C</code> representing the <code>char</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>Z</code> representing the <code>boolean</code> base type</li>
 * <li><code>V</code> representing void function return values</li>
 * </ul>
 * The name of a Class representing a base type is the keyword which is used to
 * represent the type in Java source code (i.e. "int" for the <code>int</code>
 * base type.</dd>
 * <dt><em>Classes representing array classes</em></dt>
 * <dd>These are Classes which represent the classes of Java arrays. There is
 * one such Class for all array instances of a given arity (number of
 * dimensions) and leaf component type. In this case, the name of the class is
 * one or more left square brackets (one per dimension in the array) followed by
 * the signature ofP the class representing the leaf component type, which can
 * be either an object type or a base type. The signature of a Class
 * representing an array type is the same as its name.</dd>
 * </dl>
