/**
 * A codec allows a sequence of bytes to be decoded into integer values (or vice
 * versa). It uses a variable-length encoding and a modified sign representation
 * such that small numbers are represented as a single byte, whilst larger
 * numbers take more bytes to encode. The number may be signed or unsigned; if
 * it is unsigned, it can be weighted towards positive numbers or equally
 * distributed using a one's complement. The codec also supports delta coding,
 * where a sequence of numbers is represented as a series of first-order
 * differences. So a delta encoding of the integers [1..10] would be represented
 * as a sequence of 10x1s. This allows the absolute value of a coded integer to
 * fall outside of the 'small number' range, whilst still being encoded as a
 * single byte.
 * 
 * A codec is configured with four parameters:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>B</dt>
 * <dd>The maximum number of bytes that each value is encoded as. B must be a
 * value between [1..5]. For a pass-through coding (where each byte is encoded
 * as itself, aka {@link #BYTE1}, B is 1 (each byte takes a maximum of 1 byte).</dd>
 * <dt>H</dt>
 * <dd>The radix of the integer. Values are defined as a sequence of values,
 * where value <code>n</code> is multipled by <code>H^<sup>n</sup></code>.
 * So the number 1234 may be represented as the sequence 4 3 2 1 with a radix
 * (H) of 10. Note that other permutations are also possible; 43 2 1 will also
 * encode 1234. The co-parameter L is defined as 256-H. This is important
 * because only the last value in a sequence may be &lt; L; all prior values
 * must be &gt; L.</dd>
 * <dt>S</dt>
 * <dd>Whether the codec represents signed values (or not). This may have 3
 * values; 0 (unsigned), 1 (signed, ones complement) or 2 (signed, but not sure
 * what the difference is) TODO Update documentation when I know what the
 * difference is</dd>
 * <dt>D</dt>
 * <dd>Whether the codec represents a delta encoding. This may be 0 (no delta)
 * or 1 (delta encoding). A delta encoding of 1 indicates that values are
 * cumulative; a sequence of <code>1 1 1 1 1</code> will represent the
 * sequence <code>1 2 3 4 5</code>. For this reason, the codec supports two
 * variants of decode; one {@link #decode(InputStream, long) with} and one
 * {@link #decode(InputStream) without} a <code>last</code> parameter. If the
 * codec is a non-delta encoding, then the value is ignored if passed. If the
 * codec is a delta encoding, it is a run-time error to call the value without
 * the extra parameter, and the previous value should be returned. (It was
 * designed this way to support multi-threaded access without requring a new
 * instance of the Codec to be cloned for each use.)
 * <dt>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * Codecs are notated as (B,H,S,D) and either D or S,D may be omitted if zero.
 * Thus {@link #BYTE1} is denoted (1,256,0,0) or (1,256). The
 * {@link #toString()} method prints out the condensed form of the encoding.
 * Often, the last character in the name ({@link #BYTE1}, {@link #UNSIGNED5})
 * gives a clue as to the B value. Those that start with U ({@link #UDELTA5},
 * {@link #UNSIGNED5}) are unsigned; otherwise, in most cases, they are signed.
 * The presence of the word Delta ({@link #DELTA5}, {@link #UDELTA5})
 * indicates a delta encoding is used.
 * 
 * This codec is really quite cool for storing compressed information, and could
 * be used entirely separately from the Pack200 implementation for efficient
 * transfer of integer data if required.
 * 
 * Note that all information is byte-oriented; for decoding float/double
 * information, the bit values are converted (not cast) into a long type. Note
 * that long values are used throughout even though most may be cast to ints;
 * this is primarily to avoid having to worry about signed values, even if it
 * would be more efficient to do so.
 * 
 * There are a number of standard codecs ({@link #UDELTA5}, {@link #UNSIGNED5},
 * {@link #BYTE1}, {@link #CHAR3}) that are used in the implementation of many
 * bands; but there are a variety of other ones, and indeed the specification
 * assumes that other combinations of values can result in more specific and
 * efficient formats. There are also a sequence of canonical encodings defined
 * by the Pack200 specification, which allow a codec to be referred to by
 * canonical number. TODO Add links to canonical numbers when this has been
 * done.
