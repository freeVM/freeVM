        	<Description>
                   Creates many objects of different sizes (10 bytes : 32MB), delete some of them (every 2d, 3d etc, this step is varied in a loop). GC is invoked explicitly. Each object has defined finalize() method. Make sure that total allocated objects size does not reach initial size of heap. Check if OutOfMemoryError not thrown. Check if finalize() methods are invoked.
