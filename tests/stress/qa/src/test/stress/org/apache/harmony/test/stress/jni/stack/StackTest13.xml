        <Description>
		Java class creates a specified number of threads. Each thread
		calls its native method. Native method calls specified
		Java method with Call_Type_Method() JNI function
		specified number of times (not so much times to cause
		stack oveflow). The Java method calls the native method again.
		At the specified depth level the native method
		carries out some calculation (non-trivial args are passed
		through all the invocations) and returns the result
		to the top level (Java main method).
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays for calculations (1000 by default)
			-invCount - Recursion depth (200 by default)
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - Timeout for waiting a thread to die (20 minutes by default)
