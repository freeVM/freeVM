        	<Description>
                   Creates many objects of different sizes (10 bytes : 32MB), delete some of them (every 2d, 3d etc, this step is varied in a loop). Each object has defined finalize() method, which contains semi-endless loop. Make sure that total allocated objects size does not reach initial size of heap. Check if OutOfMemoryError not thrown. Check if finalize() methods are invoked.
