		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under Thread and
			ReferenceTypeIDs stressing. First, test loads very big number of classes
			on debuggee side, creates separate thread and starts it vast number of
			time. Each created thread is suspended on proper event, test sends
			<code>ClassType.InvokeMethod</code> command for
			<code>methodToInvoke</code> method without waiting a reply. Then test
			runs <code>VirtualMachine.AllClasses</code> command and saves and
			checks returned RefTypeIDs. Loads vast number of new classes, sends
			<code>VirtualMachine.AllClasses</code> and compares returned by the
			second AllClasses command RefTypeIDs with RefTypeIDs saved after the
			first AllClasses command. Then checks if all RefTypeIDs have expected
			SourceFile and signatures. Then checks replies for each
			<code>ClassType.InvokeMethod</code> command.
