        <Description>
		Starting thread which initiates StackOverflowError during all time by means method recursive invocation.
		Padding memory by big objects till OutOfMemoryError, then
		padding memory by small objects till OutOfMemoryError, then release some memory.
		Starting a lot of threads. Each thread tries to get synchronized and unsynchronized access to object-synchronizer.
		Every thread invokes method from object-synchronizer which normally returns int 1.
		This result current thread writing to the array in the main thread in position
		corresponding to the number of current thread. (By default array filled by 0).
		Thus, after work of all threads, main thread has an array which normally should be filled by all 1.
		Main thread checks it and, if not, returns fail with some logging information.
		Input parameters:
					-numThreads. Number of threads to be create.
					-smallObjSize. Size of small padding objects.
					-freeMem. Quantity of free memory in small objects.
					-oOMEr. (on or off), OutOfMemoryError (low memory conditions).
					-sOEr. (on or off), StackOverflowError (stack overflow conditions).
					-synchUnsynchor. (synch, unsynch or both) synchronized or unsynchronized access.
