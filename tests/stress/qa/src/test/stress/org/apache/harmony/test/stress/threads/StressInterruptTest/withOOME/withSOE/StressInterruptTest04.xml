        <Description>
		Starting a lot of threads. Every second thread (odd) interrups previous (even).
		Even threads waits and normally never awakes. After interruption, InterruptedException catches.
		Then it writing 1 to the array in the main thread in position corresponding to the number of this thread.
		Thus, after work of all threads, main thread has an array which normally should be filled by all 1.
		Main thread checks it and, if not, returns fail with some logging information.
		Input parameters:
					-numThreads. Number of threads to be create.
					-smallObjSize. Size of small padding objects.
					-freeMem. Quantity of free memory in small objects.
					-sleepTime. Time to sleep.
					-oOMEr. (on or off), OutOfMemoryError (low memory conditions).
					-sOEr. (on or off), StackOverflowError (stack overflow conditions).
