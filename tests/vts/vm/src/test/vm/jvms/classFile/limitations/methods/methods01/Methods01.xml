    <Description>
		Test to limitation of methods number contained in a class.
		By default quantity of methods are limited by size of 2 bytes 
		methods_count item (65535). 
		This limitation crosses with limitation to constant_pool_count. 
		Finally, class can contain only 65521 methods
		(63518 generated "methodNNNNN",(where NNNNN is a method number) 
		+ "main" + "test" + class constructor).
		It is expected that class (with 65521 methods) which is generated 
		in test will be loaded without any problem.
