        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if exception object is used in catch block.
            Test case details:
            Throws and catches an TestException in a loop. 
            In the catch block calls testMethod() method of TestException object.
            testMethod() changes the value of the boolean test class variable from 'false' to 'true'.
            Checks the result of the method execution. If the value of boolean test class variable is 'true'
            it means TestException object was created, i.e. lazyexc wasnâ€™t performed.
