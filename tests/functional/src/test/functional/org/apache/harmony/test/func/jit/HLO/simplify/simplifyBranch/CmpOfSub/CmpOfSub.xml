            Tests branch simplification pass of JIT compiler.
            Tests that following simplifications are performed correctly:
            x GT (y-1)  ->  x GTE y
            (x-1) GTE y  ->  x GT y
            x GTE (y-(-1))  ->  x GT y
            (x-(-1)) GT y  ->  x GTE y
            GT means greater, GTE means greater or equal.
