            <Description>
The test is against exec1015 method.
It exerecises the fillowing:

1) Executes the specified string command in a separate process 
   with the specified environment and working diretory. 

For testing purposes JVM is used.
The String[] envp argument contains the "java.home" property.
The "File dir" argument is null;
there is, however, no special checks on it,
that is, only the trivial check is perfrmed.

The test performs the following checks on the method.
- If a String argument beginning with a "java" command
  contains the "-help" token, that is, the command to launch JVM is correct,
  the exit value returned on a process exit is 0.
- If a String argument beginning with a "java" command
  contains no tokens, that is, the command to launch JVM is incorrect,
  the exit value returned on a process exit is 1.
