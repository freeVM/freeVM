            Tests redundant array bounds check elimination.
            Test contains a loop where the value of the loop control variable and 
            the index of array element called inside the loop depend on each other. 
            As the result of this dependency an array element called with negative 
            index on the second iteration. 
            Checks that ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException would be thrown.
