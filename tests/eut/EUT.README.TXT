        How to run Eclipse Unit Tests suite on Apache Harmony
        #####################################################

This document describes how to run Eclipse Unit Tests (EUT) on Apache Harmony.
The following platforms are currently supported:
    Windows x86, Linux x86, Linux x86_64.

---------------
Directory Content
---------------

This directory contains scripts for running EUT. The directorie structure
is as follows:

eut/                                       - EUT scripts directory
  |
  |-+extra/                                - extra scripts and patches that might be useful for EUT runs
  |  |
  |  |-+eut.3.2.jdtcorecompiler.patching/  - patches for EUT 3.2 'jdtcorecompiler' suite in order to pass on Apache Harmony
  |    |
  |    |-+patch/                           - directory containing patches to be applied
  |    |
  |    |--build.xml                        - script that applies the patches
  |    |
  |    |--properties                       - patching pre-requisites settings (EUT and Eclipse 3.2 location)
  |    |
  |    |--readme.txt                       - readme file describing the patches
  |
  |--build.xml                             - main EUT suite launching script
  |
  |--efl.${os}.${arch}                     - platform specific expected failures lists
  |
  |--EUT.README.txt                        - this readme file describing standalone EUT run
  |
  |--eut.properties                        - EUT properties

--------------
Configuration:
--------------
* Make sure that PATH environment variable contains JRE 1.5 (use RI) and Apache
Ant (version >=1.6.5), and that JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME are properly set up. Make
sure that 'unzip' tool can also be found in your PATH.

* If you use proxy server,
specify proxy settings by setting ANT_OPTS environment variable:
Windows:
    set ANT_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=1111"
Linux:
    export ANT_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=1111"

* For Linux only: make sure that X server is up and running and set $DISPLAY
environment variable to the appropriate value.

* Edit eut.properties file:
    * specify JRE to use for EUT run (test.jre.home=)
    * for Linux only: specify windowing system type if it differs from gtk
    (ws=motif)
    * modify other properties if necessary (optional): vm.options (options to
    specify for JRE under test), tests (comma-separated testsuites list), timeout
    (in milliseconds, default is 7200000)
    * specify CVS settings if you want to run Team CVS tests (cvs_user, cvs_password,
    cvs_host, cvs_root)

* Create or edit expected failures list (platform specific list of testcases
that are expected to fail) if necessary. It should be stored at the same
directory as build.xml and named as efl.${os}.${arch} where ${os}.${arch}
can be windows.x86, linux.x86 or linux.x86_64.

* Note: the patches from 'extra' are not applied automatically, please see
'Know Issues' section below.

------
Setup:
------
$cd <directory where build.xml is located>
$ant setup

----
Run:
----
For Linux only: set DISPLAY to appropriate value.
$cd <directory where build.xml is located>
$ant [-Dtests=suite1,suite2,suite3,...]
where suite1,suite2,suite3,... is a comma-separated list of test suites to run.
By default (no target suites specified) all suites will be run. Please see
readme.html in eclipse-Automated-Tests*.zip for more details.

--------
Results:
--------
Results summary can be found in the file results/<timestamp>/report.txt, detailed
tests output is stored in the file results/<timestamp>/output.txt, where <timestamp>
is the directory name based suite's run date and time. Note that expected failures
list (specific for the platform) are used to process EUT run results and only
unexpected failures, error and crashes are reported. Full test results list
(including expected failures) in xml and html format can be found at
results/<timestamp>/results.

Known Issues:
-------------
1. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=172820:
   Several classes from org/eclipse/jdt/core/tests/compiler, org/eclipse/jdt/core/tests/runtime,
   org/eclipse/jdt/core/tests/util use hard-coded class library path that doesn't
   work for Apache Harmony. The patch extra/eut.3.2.jdtcorecompiler.patching/patch/patch_eclipse172820
   contains workaround for this issue for EUT 3.2, because its fix is committed
   to Eclipse 3.3 only. See 'extra/eut.3.2.jdtcorecompiler.patching/readme.txt'
   for details on how to apply the patch.
2. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=188127:
   Some tests from org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.eval suite fail because the timeout
   for VM launch is not enough for DRLVM. The patch consists in increasing the
   timeout to 30 seconds.
3. As a temporary workaround for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-2914
   set open files limit to 64000 when running on Linux.
