     * There is a contract between disable_count value and Java code:

     * take place when the native code makes disable_count equal to zero.
     * To do this, the native code must guarantee that the GC is able to
     * see all live references the native code is working with. And that
     * the native code will not read/write live references while disable_count
     * is equal to zero. This happens within suspension safe points or
     * within VM helpers safe regions.
     *
     * Safepoint callback function could call Java code. If this happens,
     * disable_count must be set to 1 before callback function execution.

     * changes only by the same thread. So there is no race condition or
     * separate usage in setting disable_count to 1.
