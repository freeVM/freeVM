// Implementation details

// This information is used by the m2n implementation and the stack iterator implementation.
// It may not be used by any other module.

// There are two types of M2nFrames: those that result from managed code calling a stub, and those that represent suspended managed code.
// The second type is needed to deal with throwing exceptions from OS contexts with the exception filter or signal mechanisms.
// For the first type:
//   eip points to the instruction past the one in question (ie is the return address into managed code)
//   the bottom two bits of p_lm2nf are zero
//   regs is not present, and is implicitly the address of the word above eip
// For the second type:
//   eip points to the instruction in question
//   p_lm2nf==1
//   regs is present
