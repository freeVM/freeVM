/**
 *@file
 * Mechanism for iterating over stack frames
 * of Java and native code.
 *
 * This stack iterator handle is a black box.
 *
 * The iteractor supports iterating over:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Managed code frames corresponding to Java
 * code
 * <li>Managed-to-native frames (M2N) for transferring
 * data and control between managed and native frames
 *
 * Native frames iteration is not currently supported. To iterate over
 * native frames, use OS-provided tools.
 * </ul>
 * This iterator uses the order from the most recently pushed frame
 * to the first frame pushed.
 * With the stack iterator, you can also resume a frame in the current thread and
 * transfer execution and control to this frame.
