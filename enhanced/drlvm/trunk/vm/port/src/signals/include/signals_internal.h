/**
* Prepares 'Registers' structure and stack area pointed in for calling
* 'fn' function with a set of arguments provided in variable args list.
* THe 'fn' function is called through a special stub function with
* preserving 'red zone' on Linux and clearing direction flag on Windows.
* After returning from 'fn' and stub, processor registers are restored
* with a values provided in 'regs' argument.
* The function can be used to prepare register context for transfering
* a control to a signal/exception handling function out of the OS handler.
*
* When the first argument passed to 'fn' is the same 'regs' pointer, its
* value is substituted with the pointer stored 'Registers' structure used
* to restore register context. If 'fn' function modifies the context
* pointed by the first argument, these changes will take effect after
* returning from 'fn'.
*
* The stub for calling 'fn' is written in assembler language; 'Registers'
* fields and size are hardcoded. It would be better to rewrite it using
* encoder in future, to keep control on 'Registers' structure and size.
*
