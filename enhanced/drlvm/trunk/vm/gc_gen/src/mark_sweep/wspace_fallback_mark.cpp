/* NOTE:: This is another marking version: marking in color bitmap table.
   Originally, we have to mark the object before put it into markstack, to
   guarantee there is only one occurrance of an object in markstack. This is to
   guarantee there is only one occurrance of a repointed ref slot in repset (they
   are put to the set when the object is scanned). If the same object is put to
   markstack twice, they will be scanned twice and their ref slots will be recorded twice.
   Problem occurs when the ref slot is updated first time with new position,
   the second time the value in the ref slot is not the old position as expected.
   It needs to read the original obj header for forwarding pointer. With the new value,
   it will read something nonsense since the obj is not moved yet.
   This can be worked around if we want.
   To do this we have to use atomic instruction for marking, which is undesirable.
   So we abondoned this design. We no longer use the repset to remember repointed slots.
