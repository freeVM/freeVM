/**
 * (This all should be considered as an experimental approach which could be changed on
 * java.lang.ref using)
 * 
 * TypeVariableRepository keeps iformation about type variables.
 * 
 * For now the following approach for keeping is realized.
 * A concreet TV instance is included into repository if somebody do the *first* request for
 * the reflect's method like Method.getGenericReturnType()->Class.MethodData.initGenericReturnType()
 * (Field.getGenericType()->Field.FieldData.initGenericType()
 *  Method.getGenericExceptionTypes()->Class.MethodData.initGenericExceptionTypes()
 *  ...
 *  Constructor.getGenericParameterTypes()->Class.ConstructorData.initGenericParameterTypes()
 *  ...
 * ). If the identical TV is accessed anyhow then the pointer from repository is used. However,
 * further it can be removed from the repository if the cache is full under the new instance including.
 * Then if reflect's request for such TV using the earlier used interface methods then the pointers
 * to such instance kept within the Method/Constructor/Field/Class instances are returned just if it is
 * absent within repository. But if we use other Method/Constructor/Field/Class instances to access
 * to some instance of the same TV type which has been removed from repository then the new
 * exemplar of instance is included into repository and the pointer to it is replicated if it needs
 * into the new Method/Constructor/Field/Class instances.
 * Another way to recreate some TV entry within repository is the AuxiliaryFinder.findTypeVariable() method
 * which can recreate the removed instance getting it within Method/Constructor/Field/Class instances
 * which were used to acces to the mentioned TV earlier.
 * 
 * Maybe, it would be more convinient to realize another repository implementation
 * where the accumulative approach will be used.
