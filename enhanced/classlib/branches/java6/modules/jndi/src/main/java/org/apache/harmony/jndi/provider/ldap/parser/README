This package contains implementation of LDAP Filter parser and URL parser,
which are generated by JavaCC. 

"filter.g" and "url.g" are JavaCC recognized grammar files respectively for LDAP
Filter and LDAP URL, all java files are generated by JavaCC.  If you want to
re-generate java files from grammar files or you have modified grammars want to
generate source code from new grammars, you can follow below steps:


** INSTALL JavaCC **

You should have JavaCC installed.

1) download JavaCC from:
   https://javacc.dev.java.net/

2) instanll JavaCC follow the instruments at: 
   https://javacc.dev.java.net/doc/installhelp.html


** GENERATE CODE **

If you have installed JavaCC correctly, generating java files is easy, go to
this directory and type something like:

	javacc filter.g

or

	javacc url.g

That generates all your needs.

For more about JavaCC, you can visit:

	https://javacc.dev.java.net/doc/docindex.html
	
which has all necessary documents on JavaCC.


NOTE: 

All generated java files have first line like this:

   /* Generated By:JavaCC: Do not edit this line. TokenMgrError.java Version 3.0 */

We recommend to move this line below the ASF comment by convention.
