/**

 * @brief Threading and Synchronization Library API.
 * 
 * The threading and synchronization API describes a programmatic interface for the 
 * generic management and use of basic threading and synchronization functionality 
 * common to most operating systems. In implementation, it will usually be a thin 
 * abstraction layer atop already-provided operating system support for these 
 * features. It is in many ways analagous to a subset of the pthreads library.
