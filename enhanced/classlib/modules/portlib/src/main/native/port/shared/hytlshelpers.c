/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup Port
 * @brief Per Thread Buffer Support
 *
 * Per thread buffers are used to store information that is not sharable among the threads.  
 * For example when an OS system call fails the error code associated with that error is
 * relevant to the thread that called the OS function; it has no meaning to any other thread.
 *
 * This file contains the functions supported by the port library for creating, accessing and
 * destroying per thread buffers.@see hyportptb.h for details on the per thread buffer structure.
 *
 * Only the function @ref hyport_tls_free is available via the port library function table.  The rest of
 * the functions are helpers for the port library only.
