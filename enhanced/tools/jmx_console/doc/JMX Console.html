<h1><a name="About_this_document"></a>About this document</h1>
<h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>This document introduces the DRL implementation of the
Java<a href="#*">*</a> Management Extensions (JMX<a href=
"#*">*</a>) Console. The document gives details on the
   JMX<a href="#*">*</a> Console design, includes an overall
   description of the package and points out basic user's actions
   while dealing with the two versions of the implementation.</p>
<h2><a name="Intended_Audience"></a>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the documentation includes a wide
community of engineers interested in using the JMX<a href=
"#*">*</a> Console in their applications and in future work with
the product to contribute to its development. The document assumes
that the readers are familiar with the JMX<a href="#*">*</a>
technology and the Java<a href="#*">*</a> programming language.</p>

<h1><a name="Introduction_to_the_JMX*_Console"></a>Introduction to
the JMX<a href="#*">*</a> Console</h1>
<p>JMX<a href="#*">*</a> introduces a new sort of applications,
called manageable. This invention effects many aspects of software
design and development. The JMX<a href="#*">*</a> application is
easy-manageable due to the control panel, a so called console,
showing the status of the application and distributing commands.
The JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console enables management of all
JMX<a href="#*">*</a> compliant systems and provides flexible and
intuitive interface for users.</p>
<h1><a name="JMX*_Console_in_DRL"></a>JMX<a href="#*">*</a> Console
in DRL</h1>
<p>The DRL JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console is the application
intended for managing of various JMX<a href="#*">*</a> compliant
systems.</p>
<h2><a name="About"></a>About</h2>
<p>The JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console is an open-source clean-room
tool targeted at managing Java<a href="#*">*</a> objects, so called
MBeans, registered in the MBean server. For more details on
JMX<a href="#*">*</a> refer to [<a href="#JMX*">1</a>] and
   [<a href="#JMX*Spec">2</a>].</p>
<p>The JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console exists in two versions
provided in the current implementation:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" align="center" width="80%">
<tr>
<td width="30%" class="TableHeading">JMX* Console Version</td>
<td width="30%" class="TableHeading">Compatibility</td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%" class="TableCell">Standalone Standard Widget
Toolkit (SWT)</td>
<td width="30%" class="TableCell">SWT 3.1.1</td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%" class="TableCell">Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a>
plug-in</td>
<td width="30%" class="TableCell">Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a> SDK,
versions 3.1.0 and 3.1.1</td></tr></table>
<p>You may use the console with other versions of SWT and
Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a> SDK, but success is not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Inside_the_JMX*_Console"></a>Inside the JMX<a href=
"#*">*</a> Console</h2>
<p>The JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console is developed according to the
Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and consists of
the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Model</b> represented by the MBean server</li>
<li><b>View</b> represented by the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.console.standalone</code>
package when used as the standalone console and by the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.console.plugin</code> package
when used as the plug-in</li>
<li><b>Controller</b> represented by the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.controller</code>
package</li></ul>
<p>The MBean server is not described in the document. For
information on it see [<a href="#MBeanServerInt">4</a>].</p>
<h3><a name="Controller"></a>Controller</h3>
<p>The controller interface serves as an abstraction from the
JMX<a href="#*">*</a> semantics. This component acts just like the
MBean Server, but makes its activities fully transparent and,
therefore, requires no knowledge of JMX<a href="#*">*</a>
specifics. This can save some of your time.</p>
<p>The Controller can connect to any JMX<a href="#*">*</a>
compliant server and expose its content. The interface and its
supporting classes are designed in a handy way for data
presentation in the Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>
<p>The Controller provides a generalized view of the JMX<a href=
"#*">*</a> server. This interface presents the registered MBeans as
objects with attributes, operations and notifications without
distinguishing them by their special meanings, if there are any, to
the MBean Server.</p>
<p>Another view is a specific MBean server "vision" of certain
MBeans, such as the MLet Service or the relation service. Note that
this feature is only declared in the interface and has no specific
implementation in the current version of the JMX<a href="#*">*</a>
console.</p>
<p>For details on the Controller, see the API documentation of the
package
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.controller</code>.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="User_Interface_Extension"></a>User Interface
Extension</h3>
<p>The user interface is an Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a> plug-in using
the Controller to obtain, send and receive data from the MBean
Server, to execute operations and to obtain notifications.
Currently, the user interface has two aspects for the further
development and extension: to add new Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a>
views depending on the <code>MBeanTreeView</code> class and to add
attribute editors to show or edit the attribute of a new type.</p>
<p class="class">New Eclipse<a href="#*">*</a> View
Implementation</p>
<p>The standard procedure of extending the Eclipse<a href=
"#*">*</a> plug-in is to create a new extension at a certain
extension point. To extend the JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console, use
the <code>org.eclipse.ui.views</code> point [<a href=
"#JMX*">5</a>].</p>
<p class="note">Note</p>
<p class="notetext">Further in the document, this extension and the
class corresponding to it are referred to as <code>view</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>view</code> class extends the
<code>org.eclipse.ui.part.ViewPart</code> class and implements the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui.IMBeanTreeDependant</code>
interface. This enables the <code>view</code> class to receive
callbacks from the MBean tree while browsing it. For more
information, see the API documentation of the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui</code> package and the
implementation patterns used in the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui.AttributeView</code>
class.</p>
<p class="class">New Attribute Editor Implementation</p>
<p>The attribute editors are located in the package
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui.editor</code>. Currently,
the implementation has certain editors for individual attribute
types:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>BooleanEditor</b> for boolean attributes</li>
<li><b>NumericEditor</b> for numbers</li>
<li><b>ArrayEditor</b> for arrays</li>
<li><b>CommonEditor</b> for all other types</li></ul>
<p>To create a new attribute editor for the type not covered by the
aforementioned editors, extend <b>AbstractEditor</b>. For details,
refer to the API documentation of the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui.editor</code> package and
follow the implementation pattern from the
<code>org.apache.harmony.x.management.ui.editor.NumericEditor</code>
class.</p>

<h2><a name="How_to_Use_the_JMX*_Console"></a>How to Use the
JMX<a href="#*">*</a> Console</h2>
<p>This section describes two basic scenarios of using the two
versions of the JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console implementation: how
to start, connect and use the JMX<a href="#*">*</a> console. From
this part of the document, you will get certain information about
usage of the console. After performing all the operations described
below, you will be able to experience all the advantages of the
