/*

This purpose of this file is to declare and/or define architecture-specific
functions. Inline functions must be defined as "extern inline".

Here is a summary of functions that need to be defined by this file or
an included file:

    int
    _jc_compare_and_swap(volatile _jc_word *word, _jc_word old, _jc_word new)

	A function that performs the following operation atomically:

	    if (*pword == old) {
		    *pword = new;
		    return JNI_TRUE;
	    } else
		    return JNI_FALSE;

    int
    _jc_build_trampoline(u_char *code, _jc_method *method, const void *func)

	A function that builds a trampoline at location pointed to by "code".
	The trampoline will be invoked using normal JCNI calling conventions
	appropriate for "method". The trampoline should do the following:

	    1. Set env->interp to "method".
	    2. Invoke "func" with the same parameters.
	    3. Return what "func" returns.

	"func" is invoked using normal calling conventions as if declared:

		rtype func(_jc_env *env, ...)

	where "rtype" is the return type appropriate for "method". Note
	that normal C promotion applies: int types smaller than int must
	be promoted to int, and float must be promoted to double.

	_jc_build_trampoline() should return the trampoline's length.

	"code" may be NULL, in which case just the length of the trampoline
	should be returned. Otherwise, "code" will point to aligned memory.

	The generated code does not need to be position-independent.

    void
    _jc_dynamic_invoke(const void *func, int jcni, int nparams,
        const u_char *ptypes, int nwords, _jc_word *words, _jc_rvalue *retval)

	Dynamically constructed C function call. Should invoke the C function
	"func" with supplied parameters. Return value should be stored in
	*retval. Must not break the stack frame pointer chain. "ptypes" has
	length "nparams" + 1 giving the parameter and return value types.
	"words" points to the Java style parameters (i.e., 2 for long/double).

	'jcni' is non-zero for JNCI functions, zero for normal C functions.
	Can be ignored if JNCI calling conventions are the same as normal
	calling conventions for a particular architecture.

	Note types Z, B, C, and S are returned as jints in "retval".

    void
    _jc_iflush(const void *mem, size_t len)

	This function should flush the CPU instruction cache for
	the given range of memory (if appropriate), as the memory
	contains newly loaded executable code.

Stack Pointer Functions
-----------------------

These functions must not call any other functions that could allocate
memory, etc. See "arch/arch_structures.h".

    const void *
    _jc_jmpbuf_sp(const sigjmp_buf *buf)

    	Returns the saved stack pointer from a sigjmp_buf structure.
