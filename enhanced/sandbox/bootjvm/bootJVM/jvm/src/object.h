 * @brief Definition of the @c @b java.lang.Object structure in
 * this real machine implementation.
 *
 * When initializing an object, the following activities happen in
 * the object array:
 *
 * <b>(1)</b> Its @link #jvm_object_hash jvm_object_hash@endlink is
 *            used to address an empty slot in the object storage area.
 *
 * <b>(2)</b> Its @link #ACC_PUBLIC ACC_xxx@endlink flags from the
 *            class file are stored into
 *            @link robject#access_flags access_flags@endlink.
 *
 * <b>(3)</b> Its @link #robject.mlock_thridx mlock_thridx@endlink
 *            is cleared, that is, no thread holds its monitor lock.
 *
 * <b>(4)</b> Since it is not a
 *            @link #jvm_object_hash_null jvm_object_hash_null@endlink
 *            value, its
 *            @link robject#status status@endlink is set to
 *            @link #OBJECT_STATUS_INUSE OBJECT_STATUS_INUSE@endlink.
 *            All other bits are clear.
 *
 * <b>(5)</b> Declare to garbage collection that this object is now
 *            referenced.
 *
 * <b>(6)</b> The data value(s) are stored in the array
 *            @link robject#object_instance_field_data
              object_instance_field_data@endlink according to their
 *            various types.  Since this array is a (jvalue), fields
 *            of @e any @b mixed type may be stored here.  For example,
 *            An (int) is stored in
 *            @link robject#object_instance_field_data
              object_instance_field_data@endlink.@link
              jvalue#_jint _jint@endlink), while an object reference is
 *            stored in @link robject#object_instance_field_data
              object_instance_field_data@endlink.@link
              jvalue#_jobjhash _jobjhash@endlink.  Notice that a
 *            @c @b java.lang.Integer is @e not an (int), and
 *            has its several fields stored in this array as their
 *            normal types.
