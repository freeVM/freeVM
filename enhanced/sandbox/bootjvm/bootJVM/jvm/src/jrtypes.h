/*!
 * @file jrtypes.h
 *
 * @brief Java architecture types, including those defined
 * by @c @b \<jni.h\>, plus real machine mappings of Java types.
 *
 * Convenient typedefs of both categories are also defined here.
 *
 * These definitions distinguish between Java types and real machine
 * types so as to keep the developer organized as to which is which
 * in processing scenarios.  The Java types begin with @p @b j and the
 * real machine types begin with @p @b r.
 *
 * The main exception to this is the JVM class file definitions from
 * the JVM spec, section 4, as implemented by
 * @link jvm/src/classfile.h classfile.h@endlink.  These
 * are followed without exception.  In fact, a number of common
 * type definitions are based on them.  The
 * @link #jvm_class_index jvm_XXX_index@endlink types
 * are typically either direct class file references (such as
 * @link #jvm_object_hash jvm_object_hash@endlink or
 * @link #jvm_field_index jvm_field_index@endlink) or are real machine
 * definitions that directly support JVM processing structures
 * (such as @link #jvm_class_index jvm_class_index@endlink or
 * @link #jvm_field_lookup_index jvm_field_lookup_index@endlink).
 *
 * The other common usage of a prefix is for variables.  It is not
 * related to this issue at all.  In this situation, the letter @b p
 * will typically be prefixed to pointers to/of any type in either
 * processing domain.
 *
 * The use of raw, native, 'C' language types such as @c @b int should
 * be restricted to system calls and library references such as
 * @c @b open(2) or @c @b strcmp(3), respectively-- also the command
 * line @c @b main() parameters, which get propagated into
 * @link #jvmargv_helpmsg() jvmargv_XXX()@endlink functions, etc.
 * Let the compiler perform any typing and sizing, which is unlikely,
 * but keep @e all other usages to the Java @c @b jTYPEDEF and real
 * machine @c @b rTYPEDEF representations.  This single exception should
 * be obvious when it occurs, and developers should be aware that this
 * convention is used ubiquitously throughout the code.
 *
 * Although definitions used by the JNI interface are found here,
 * JNI is kept as a STRICTLY SEPARATE part of the code, and
 * @c @b \<jni.h\> is ONLY used there, namely in the @b ../include
 * area.
 *
 * @note The @e only place that JNI definitions are used is in the
 *       @c @b JniSomeJavaClassWithNativeMethods.c source file as
 *       found in its @c @b some.java.class.with.native.methods
 *       directory.  For example, the Java class
 *       @c @b java.lang.Object has its Java source file stored
 *       in @link jni/src/harmony/generic/0.0/src/java/lang/Object.java
       jni/src/vendor/product/version/src/java/lang/Object.java@endlink,
 *       with its native support found in the 'C' source file
 *       @link jni/src/harmony/generic/0.0/src/java_lang_Object.c
         jni/src/vendor/product/version/src/java_lang_Object.c@endlink.
 *       The JNI header used to access this native
 *       @c @b java.lang.Object code is found in the related
 *       @b include directory as
 *       @link jni/src/harmony/generic/0.0/include/java_lang_Object.h
      jni/src/vendor/product/version/include/java_lang_Object.h@endlink.
