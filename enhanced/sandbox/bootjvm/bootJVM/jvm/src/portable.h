/*!
 * @brief Portable edition of @c @b jmp_buf structure.
 *
 * @attention Early on in the project, two @c @b jmp_buf structures were
 *            part of a source file along with other global and
 *            @c @b static variables.  Sometimes the @c @b longjmp(3)
 *            would return the correct return code, but sometimes, for
 *            reasons unknown then, it would return zero as if
 *            @c @b setjmp(3) had been called instead!  It is
 *            speculated that there was a structure packing issue
 *            at hand, where one of the last members was the
 *            @c @b longjmp(3) return code that got stomped on
 *            because the source file declaring the @c @b jmp_buf
 *            had a shorter idea of the structure size than did the
 *            library function such that the return code got set to
 *            zero by the declaring file using structure packing
 *            when it thought it was updating an adjacent variable.
 *            When the library routine @c @b longjmp(3) ran, using
 *            an unpacked structure, it read what should have been
 *            the return code and returned zero instead of what had
 *            originally been there.  Or something along those lines.
 *            The solution?  Use the same structure packing everywhere,
 *            which cannot be guaranteed.  The workaround?  Declare
 *            some padding following the @c @b jmp_buf to protect the
 *            end of the structure from corruption.  How much storage?
 *            Who knows?  Therefore, simply guess and add a duplicate
 *            @c @b jmp_buf adjacent to the first, which @e should
 *            supply more than enough padding to do the job.
 *
 * @internal This structure is @e horrible.  It is @e ugly.
 *           But it @e guarantees that absolutely no structure
 *           packing or lack thereof will compromise the integrity
 *           of an initialized @c @b jmp_buf.  There really is
 *           no other way to do it except add a third member here
 *           for more padding (which is probably not necessary),
 *           or to perform heap allocation, as is done in
 *           @link jvm/src/thread.c thread.c@endlink.  However,
 *           due to the non-local return nature of the structure
 *           any way, and since there are other non-local handlers
 *           active at the same time for other conditions, it is
 *           better to be ugly and correct than simple and pretty,
 *           yet vulnerable to failures.
