# @brief Build main JVM development area and/or JVM library archive

# (Please refer to @link ./roster.sh roster.sh@endlink as to why
# the <b>@@file</b> directive is constructed the way that it is.)
#
# Default to building the main JVM development area, but also build
# the JVM library archive, typically controlled by
# @link ./Makefile ./Makefile@endlink .  The default may be changed
# here in this file to build one or the other or both or neither
# by default.
#
# <ul>
# <li><b>make BOOTJVM=any-non-null-string</b> (Default) Build main
#                                             JVM development area (in
#                                             @e this area,
#                                             @c @b jvm/bin ).
#
# </li>
# <li><b>make LIBJVM=any-non-null-string</b>  Build JVM static library
#                                             archive file (in the
#                                             @c @b libjvm/lib area,
#                                             just like old
#                                             @c @b build.sh did and
#                                             how Eclipse still does).
# </li>
# </ul>
