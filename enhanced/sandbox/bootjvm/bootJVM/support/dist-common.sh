#
# @brief Common code for
# @link ./dist-src.sh dist-src.sh@endlink and
# @link ./dist-bin.sh dist-bin.sh@endlink and
# @link ./dist-doc.sh dist-doc.sh@endlink.
#
# This script is common to several scripts and is not designed to do
# anything on its own.
#
# @note Originally, the build scripts @c @b build.sh and @c @b clean.sh
#       were used to build this project.  This was a matter of
#       expediency, knowing full well that a need for @c @b Makefiles
#       would not be too far away.  Both of those scripts also used
#       this common inclusion, but their functions, being superceded
#       by @c @b Makefiles , have been removed, leaving only the
#       distribution functions.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-support-dist-common.sh-1  Combine all distribution
#       functions into a single @c @b dist.sh script and move this
#       logic into that script, eliminating this file.
#
# All source code compiled according to selections from
# @link ./config.sh config.sh@endlink.  This may or may not include
# any or all of:
#
# <ul>
# <li>@b jvm:      The main JVM development area.  All source code
#                  is found here.  Building this area will compile
#                  source code and link it into a binary form in
#                  @b jvm/bin/bootjvm </li>
#
# <li>@b libjvm:   JVM code as a static library.  Compile the source
#                  code from @b jvm/src (less
#                  @link jvm/src/jvmmain.c jvmmain.c@endlink) and
#                  archive it into @b libjvm/lib/libjvm.a </li>
#                  (Note:  Due to the fact that @b libjvm/src is a
#                  symbolic link to @b jvm/src , this functionality
#                  is @e only performed here by the Eclipse project
#                  files.  When using @c @b make for normal building,
#                  @b jvm/src is the actual directory, but its
#                  @link jvm/src/Makefile Makefile@endlink is set up
#                  to compile both a library and a binary.  See
#                  @link ./Makefile ./Makefile@endlink for details.)
#
# <li>@b main:     Sample @link main/src/jvmmain.c main()@endlink
#                  program.  This program is currently not a unique
#                  program, but is a symbolic link to
#                  @link jvm/src/jvmmain.c jvm/src/jvmmain.c@endlink.
#                  This may change as necessary.  Compile @b main()
#                  that contains an invokation of the main JVM entry
#                  point @link jvm/src/jvm.c jvm()@endlink and
#                  link to @b libjvm/lib/libjvm.a .</li>
#
# <li>@b jni:      Sample JNI subset, showing how to reference
#                  the local native methods, but using the full
#                  JNI mechanism.  Compile code that meets JNI
#                  naming and prototype conventions that would
#                  normally be stored in a shared object @b .so
#                  or @b .dll file.  (Here it will be statically linked
#                  into a regular binary.)  Then statically link this
#                  code to @b libjvm/lib/libjvm.a .</li>
#
# <li>@b test:     Java test programs for exercising various parts
#                  of the JVM</li>
#
# <li>@b dox:      Documentation of source code in @b jvm directory
# </ul>
#
# Each of these directories contains a @c @b Makefile build script.
# In addition to these, an Eclipse project file is available in each
# for use with the Eclipse C/C++ plugin, so this entire directory tree
# may be imported wholesale into an Eclipse workspace and used without
# changes.  (Eclipse 3.0.2 generated these files.)  Notice that
# the Eclipse setup does not build the documentation set.  This must
# be done manually with the top-level 'make dox'.
#
# @attention For Eclipse uses, be aware that the <b>\$(LFLAGS)</b>
# compile options must be the same as found in
# @link support/MakeRules support/MakeRules@endlink.  These are
# unfortunately @e not directly available to Eclipse and @e must be
# manually verified there-- also check that the compiler <b>\$(CC)</b>
# and archiver <b>\$(AR)</b> and linker <b>$(LN)</b> are correctly
# specified in both placed.  They should be entered in the project
# build parameters for C/C++ in the miscellaneous parameters section.
#  For example,
# @b -m32 and @b -m64 .
#
# Notice that @c @b make may be run instead of or as well as an
# Eclipse build.  There is only a slight difference as to
# where the compiled object files are stored, but the binaries
# and library archives are stored in the same place for both
# methods.  However, @e never use Eclipse for release and
# distribution builds since @c @b make is the "official" release
# method, as it were.
