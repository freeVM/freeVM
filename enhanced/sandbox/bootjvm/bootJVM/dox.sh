# @brief Create project documentation with @b Doxygen.
#
# Generate @b Doxygen documentation from source code containing
# appropriate documentation tags.  Customize the output to
# to eliminate unwanted warnings.
#
# @note Using GENERATE_RTF=YES seems to cause the spurious
#       message, "QGDict::hashAsciiKey: Invalid null key"
#       on otherwise working and valid documentation.
#       The reasons are not yet known, and it may be that
#       the directive file needs some different settings.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-dox.sh-1 Identify reason for spurious message on
#       RTF output as described above.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-dox.sh-2 A proper solution to old NetScape 4.7X
#       processing the HTML tag <b>&lt;pre class="fragment"&gt;</b>
#       syntax needs to be found and implemented so that
#       <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> and <b>@@verbatim</b> fragments, etc.,
#       may be displayed with proper framing @e and with proper
#       newlines and white space.  For the interim solution, see
#       the end of this script.  The problem will probably be
#       solved by adjusting the <b>doxygen.css</b> (the default
#       @b .css file) or supplying one that is customized for
#       the project or perhaps just for old NetScape browsers.
#       The scripts @link ./dox-patch.sh dox-patch.sh@endlink and
#       @link ./dox-unpatch.sh dox-unpatch.sh@endlink that support
#       the interim solution might also be used in support of the
#       proper solution if an "original" and a "patched" version of
#       the style sheet exists in the HTML output directory.
#       The alternative is to have an original and patched version
#       of the HTML pages, which might be preferable, depending on
#       the actual visual artifacts.  In this case, a patch/unpatch
#       script might either not be such a good idea or would be a bit
#       more complex to implement.  In any event, the correct approach
#       is to find the HTML problem and fix it, probably in the
#       style sheet.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-dox.sh-3 Perhaps the above to-do item should be
#       generalized for the old NetScape 4.7X browser since is
#       seems to have some overall problems with fonts in the
#       default <b>doxygen.css</b> style sheet.  Perhaps someone with
#       CSS experience could contribute one or more style sheets
#       for use with different types of browsers so the HTML
#       documents look the same on all of them.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-dox.sh-4 Consider the creation of a <b>.css</b>
#       file that is customized especially for this project.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-dox.sh-1 A Windows .BAT version of this
#       script needs to be written
#
# @bug HARMONY-6-dox.sh-1001 If the token
#      sequence "@b @c word1 word2..." is used, two words
#      get bolded instead of one (Doxygen 1.4.4).  Likewise
#      with "@b @p word1 word2..."  By reversing the sequence,
#      only one word gets bolded.  Is this a "bug" or a "feature"?
