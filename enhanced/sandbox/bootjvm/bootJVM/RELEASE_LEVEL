# @file ./RELEASE_LEVEL
#
# @brief Release level for this software package.
#
# The release level contains three numeric fields separated by
# a dot or period character.  They include a major release number,
# a minor release number, and a patch level release number.  Each
# field may contain up to four digits.  Leading zeroes are disallowed.
# Thus the release level <b>12.34.5678</b> consists of:
#
# <ul>
# <li><b>Major release:</b> 12
#
# </li>
# <li><b>Minor release:</b> 34
#
# </li>
# <li><b>Patch level:</b> 5678
#
# </li>
# </ul>
#
# This value is manually entered below as a stand-alone string
# that is used by @link ./config.sh config.sh@endlink to define
# the compile-time version of @b RELEASE_LEVEL in
# @link config/config.h config/config.h@endlink.  That value may
# be overridden at configuration time, but this is not necessary
# unless a software release is being done.
#
# The only time this value should be changed is at release time.
# It is recommended to change it @e here, then run
# @link ./config.sh config.sh@endlink again to pick up the
# new value, then rebuild all the code and documentation.
#
# It is recommended to summarize all code base changes in the
# checkin message for this file.  This text should also be
# inserted in this file at the location shown below.  Be sure
# to indicate the @e previous revision level at the top of the
# most current comments @e before adding new information.  (This
# is a chicken-and-egg problem-- the exact revision level is not
# known until the file is checked in, so it cannot be included
# in the text beforehand and be completely accurate.)

# There is @e exactly one line of text in this file that is not

# There may be no other such text at all in this file for it to

#
# <ul>
# <li>Most current release level in format <b>12.34.5678</b>:  (Insert
# <i>previous</i> revision level in the following <i>italicized</i>
# blank _______ location before adding new annotations.  Use earlier
# entries as a guideline.  Be sure to include a blank line after each entry
# since this makes the formatted output easier to read.)
# </li>
#
# <li><b>0.0.4</b>      Revision <i>_______</i>:  Added support for
#                       remaining opcode corrections.
#
#                       Implement the ATHROW opcode.
#
#                       Support for reading Java archives.
#
#                       Significantly increased development diagnostic
#                       support functions.
# </li>
#
# <li><b>0.0.3</b>      Revision <i>r397716</i>:  Snapshot reflecting
#                       memory alignment structure naming changes.
#
#                       Structure packing of all key structures.
#
#                       Java 5 annotation support.
# </li>
#
# <li><b>0.0.2</b>      Revision <i>r391531</i>:  Snapshot of
#                       code that implements all opcodes except ATHROW.
# </li>
#
# <li><b>0.0.1</b>      Revision <i>r327202</i>:  Changed release level
#                       narrative for better conformance with ASF policy.
#
#                       Added default release level so developers don't have
#                       to be concerned with release policy during
#                       configuration.  This is implemented as a new
#                       ./RELEASE_LEVEL file.
#
#                       Added platform-specific JDK header file to '-I'
#                       include path.  This is queried from the user from
#                       a list of valid subdirectories to JAVA_HOME/include
# </li>
#
# <li><b>0.0.0</b>      Revision <i>r307257</i>:  Original contribution
#                       as Harmony JIRA entry HARMONY-6.
