ABOUT

This folder contains helper files to build DRLVM with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 for EM64T platform

In this version some DRLVM MSVC subprojects (both release & debug configurations)
use external headers and libraries from:
drlvm/trunk/build/win_em64t_msvc_debug folder (apr.h ...). 

So you have to build DRLVM using standard way (build update/build), before you can use MSVC build.
