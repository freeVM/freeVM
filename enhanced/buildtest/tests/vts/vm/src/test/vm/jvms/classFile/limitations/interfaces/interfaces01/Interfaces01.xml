    <Description>
	Test limitation of quantity of direct superinterfaces. 
	By default quantity of superinterfaces are limited by size of 2 bytes 
	interfaces_count item (65535). 
	This limitation crosses with limitation for constant_pool_count.
	Finally, class can implement only 32760 ( (65535-15) / 2  ), 
	because 2 constant pool elements need for 1 interface description.  
	It is expected that class (implemented 32762 interfaces) which is generated 
	in test will be loaded without any problem.

	Covered assertions assert_class933
