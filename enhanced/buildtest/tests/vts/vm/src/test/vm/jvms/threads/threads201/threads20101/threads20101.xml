<Test ID="threads20101" date-of-creation="2006-06-29" timeout="1">
  <Author value="Maxim N. Kurzenev"/>
  <Description>
      The test initializes the following fields
              a = 1;
              b = 2;
              c = d = 0;
      
      and starts two threads. The first thread concurrently calls
      the following method:

          public synchronized void anny() {
              a = 3;
              b = 4;
          }

      While the second thread calls concurrently the following method:

          public void betty() {
              c = a;
              d = b;
          }

      (only first method is synchronized)
      After threads finished their calls, the master thread makes a synchronous check
      of c and d values, for c to be either 1 or 3, for d to be either 2 or 4.
      The procedure is repeated until timeout specified by delay parameter is reached.
