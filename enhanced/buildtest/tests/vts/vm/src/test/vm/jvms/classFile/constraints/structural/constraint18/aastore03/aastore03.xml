  <Description>
      Tests that the type of value stored into an array of type reference by an aastore
      instruction must be assignment with the component type of the array.
      Tries to store aastore03nInterface into the array of type aastore03n.
      T is not java.lang.Object.
      (If S is interface type: If T is a class type, then T must be Object).
      This assertion tests through the arrays - in other way impossible 
      to receive "pure" interface object.
      Must throw VerifyError or runtime exception ArrayStoreException.

      Covered assertions assert_class698
