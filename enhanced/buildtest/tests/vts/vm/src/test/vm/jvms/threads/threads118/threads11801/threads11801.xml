  <Description>
      We don't have direct access to atomic actions like store or use 
      so we just trigger them with less atomic actions and check the
      expected induced consequences.

      We also have no sure method to trigger prescient store mechanism
      in these tests, but at least can check the correctness of outcome
      regardless of whether prescient store occured or not.
            
      The test makes an assignment to A, unlocks a lock  to force a store
      operation on A and throws an Exception. After that the test checks
      the local copy of A to be equal to what it has assigned to it. Wrong
      value treated as a failure to perform a required assign operation.

      The test is repeated until the time specified by delay parameter elapses.
