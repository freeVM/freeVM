<Test ID="threads11007" date-of-creation="2006-07-04" timeout="1">
  <Author value="Maxim N. Kurzenev"/>
  <Description>
      The test declares volatile double variable v and starts the thread which
      continuously increments v.

      Master thread also saves the reference to itself into variable t.
      Master thread then continuously makes the following assignments:

      v1 = v;
      v2 = t.v;
      v3 = v;

      and checks that v2 is not greater than v3. Failing this means that v3 holds
      actually the cached value of v used for v1 which in turn violates rules for
      volatile variables.

      The procedure is repeated until timeout specified by delay parameter is reached.
