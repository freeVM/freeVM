  <Description>
      The test checks that:
          - while locking any lock a thread flushes all local values for
            variables and further loads them anew when needed (in more detail,
            it is checked that externally modified field is seen to a thread
            with a new value after acquiring a lock)
          - while unlocking any lock a thread writes into main memory all
            values assigned by it to variables (in more detail, it is checked
            that the modified field as seen by another thread has a new value
            after unlocking a lock by the current thread)
