  <Description>
    Tests bitwise float notion for fdiv instruction.
    fdiv two float values and compare bitwise result with bitwise int.
    Value1 contain max positive float value.
    Two input float values constructed from two int values. 
    The last bit masks according to IEEE 754 standard.
