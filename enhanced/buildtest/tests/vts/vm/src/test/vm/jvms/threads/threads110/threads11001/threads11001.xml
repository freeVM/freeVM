<Test ID="threads11001" date-of-creation="2006-06-30" timeout="1">
  <Author value="Maxim N. Kurzenev"/>
  <Description>
      The test declares volatile long variable v and starts two threads. The threads
      concurrently repeatedly assign 0x00000000FFFFFFFF and 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 to v.

      Master thread continuously checks the value of v, to be either
      0x00000000FFFFFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 and returns failed status otherwise.
      The procedure is repeated until timeout specified by delay parameter is reached.
