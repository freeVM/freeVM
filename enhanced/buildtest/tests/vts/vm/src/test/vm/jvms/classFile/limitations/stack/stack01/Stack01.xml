    <Description>
        Tests size of an operand stack in a frame. 
        This size is limited to 65535 values by the max_stack field 
        of the Code_attribute structure. 
        This limitation confronts with limitation to code_length (65535) and 
        As a result of this constraint, and by using iconst_0 instruction 
        we can push onto the operand stack only 65534 int "0" values.
        It is expected that test will passed without any problem.
