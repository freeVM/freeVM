  <Description>
    Tests bitwise double notion for dmul instruction.
    dmul two double values and compare bitwise result with bitwise long.
    Result contains positive denormalized double value.
    Two input double values constructed from two long values. 
    The last 6 bits masks according to IEEE 754 standard.
