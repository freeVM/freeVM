  <Description>
      Checks consistency of order of lock and unlock operations performed
      by threads on some object.
      
      The two threads cycle through the following set of actions

      first:
          synchronized (lock) {
              while (true) {
                  a++;
                  lock.notify();
                  lock.wait();
              }
          }

      second:
          synchronized (lock) {
              while (true) {
                  a--;
                  lock.notify();
                  lock.wait();
              }
          }

      after each iteration through while bodies in both threads the check
      is made that the value of a is unchanged as a result of sequential
      single increment and decrement operations. (Interruption, exception
      handling and value check mechanisms are omitted in the code above for
      clarity).
                                                      
      Wrong value of a in the above terms at any iteration is treated as
      inconsistency of locking/unlocking operations order and reported as
      a failure.

      Test is repeated until the time specified by delay parameter elapses.
