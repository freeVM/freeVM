  <Description>
      We don't have direct access to atomic actions like store or use 
      so we just trigger them with less atomic actions and check the
      expected induced consequences.

      The test makes the following sequence of assignments:
            A = 1;
            B = 2;
            C = 3;
            C = B;
            B = A;
            A = C;
      After that it checks the values of A and C to be == 2 and B == 1
      Any other case means that the order of use and assign actions performed
      by the current thread did not follow the order dictated by the
      mentioned sequence of assignments and treated as a failure.

      Test is repeated until the time specified by delay parameter elapses.
