<Test ID="threads17901" date-of-creation="2006-06-29" timeout="1">
  <Author value="Maxim N. Kurzenev"/>
  <Description>
      The test initializes the following fields
              a = 1;
              b = 2;

      and starts two threads. The first thread concurrently calls
      the following method:

          public synchronized void anny() {
              a = b;
          }

      While the second thread calls concurrently the following method:

          public synchronized void betty() {
              b = a;
          }

      (both methods are synchronized)
      After threads finished their calls, the master thread makes a synchronous
      check of a and b values, to be equal to each other and both equal
      to either 1 or 2.
      The procedure is repeated until timeout specified by delay parameter is reached.
