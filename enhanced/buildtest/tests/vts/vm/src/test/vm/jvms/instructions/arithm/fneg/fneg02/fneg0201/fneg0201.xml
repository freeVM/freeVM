  <Description>
    Tests bitwise float notion for fneg instruction.
    fneg float value and compare bitwise result with bitwise int.
    Operations with max positive float value and min negative float value.
    Input float value constructed from int value. 
    The last bit masks according to IEEE 754 standard.
