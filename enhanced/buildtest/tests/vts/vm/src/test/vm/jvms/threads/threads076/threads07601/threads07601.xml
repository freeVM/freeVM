  <Description>
      We don't have direct access to atomic actions like store or use 
      so we just trigger them with less atomic actions and check the
      expected induced consequences.

      The test starts a thread T1 that assigns a value to variable V and dies.
      The test then starts a thread T2 that checks if it sees the proper value of V
      assigned by T1.
      
      Assign by T1 on V causes store operation by T1 on V which in turn causes
      write operation by main memory on a master copy of V. 
      
      Value check of V by T2 triggers load by T2 of its working copy of V,
      which in turn must trigger read of master copy of V by the main memory.
      
      If T2 sees the wrong value of V it means that at least one of the above
      write or read operations was not performed.
