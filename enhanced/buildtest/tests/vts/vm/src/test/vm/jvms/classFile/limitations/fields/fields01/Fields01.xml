    <Description>
		Test to limitation of fields number contained in a class.
		By default quantity of fields are limited by size of 2 bytes 
		fields_count item (65535). 
		This limitation crosses with limitation to constant_pool_count.
		Finally, class can contain only 65524 fields.
		It is expected that class (with 65524 fields) which is generated 
		in test will be loaded without any problem.
