  <Description> 
      Tests i2d java virtual machine instruction.
      Checks that i2d convert type of value from operand stack and push correct result,
      if int value = 2147483647(MAX_VALUE) then result is 2.147483647E9. 
      (This situation is not testable, as there is no way to set double value = 2.147483647E9 by Jasmin. 
      Thus int value = 214748368.)
