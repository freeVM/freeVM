  <Description>
      Checks that lock operation on a lock succeeds only if the number of other threads'
      unlock operations on that lock match the number of corresponding lock operations.
      In more detail:
          - lock the object O twice
          - start the helper thread which tries to lock O and sets a flag after that
          - unlock the object O once
          - check that the flag is not set yet
          - unlock the object O once more
          - check that the flag is set now
      (There are even more details in the code since we need also
      accurate synchronized access to the flag)
      
      Covered assertions assert_thread094
