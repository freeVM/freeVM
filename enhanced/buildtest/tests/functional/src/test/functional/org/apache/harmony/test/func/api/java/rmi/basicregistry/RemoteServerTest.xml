        The test verifies that local server can successfully call
        methods from the remote server.
        Step by Step:
        1. The test rises remote VM (Runtime.exec method used)
        2. The remote VM creates Server objects (the number of objects are
           given as a parameters)
           The test represents the client.
        3. The test calls method from the remote server and verify that 
           data returned is correct.
           
        The test can rise any number of remote VMs and create any number of 
        Server objects and the main purpose of this test is the usage in the 
        stress test suite
