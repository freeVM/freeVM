            <Description>
                For this test simple implementation of the Context
                interface - SimpleCtx is used.
                
                Test design:
                1. Create an instance of initial context 
                   (own RMI SP is used as service provider) - ctx.
                2. Bind the Reference, pointing to the SimpleCtx, to the 
                   name "Hello" in the RMI registry.
                3. Invoke ctx.lookup("Hello/there").
                4. Verify that the method lookup("there") of the 
                   SimpleCtx invoked. This method should return "Ok".
                5. Verify that the method ctx.lookup("Hello/there") returns "Ok".
                6. Perform above operations with other methods of the 
                   initial context (bind, rebind, unbind etc.).
