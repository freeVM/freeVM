        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if a compiled method has side effect 
            between 'new' and 'throw' (for the same exception object) statements.
            Test case details:
            Throws and catches an TestException in a loop, but doesn’t call exception object in catcher. 
            Calls testMethod() of TestException object somewhere between 'new' and 'throw'.
            This method does an external operation - creates a file.
            Checks that file is created, that means Exception object is created, 
            i.e. lazyexc isn’t performed.
