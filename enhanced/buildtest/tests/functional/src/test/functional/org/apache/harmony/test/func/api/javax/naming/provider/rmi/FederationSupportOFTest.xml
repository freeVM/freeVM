            <Description>
                For this test simple implementation of the Context
                interface - SimpleCtx is used. Also, the test uses simple 
                implementation of the ObjectFactory - SimpleObjectFactory.
                The method getObjectInstance() of the SimpleObjectFactory 
                always returns an instance of SimpleCtx.
                
                Test design:
                1. Create an instance of initial context 
                   (own RMI SP is used as service provider) - ctx. 
                   Environment property java.naming.factory.object points to 
                   the SimpleObjectFactory.
                2. Bind simple remote object to the name "Hello" in the RMI registry.
                3. Invoke ctx.lookup("Hello/there").
                4. Verify that the method getObjectInstance() of the 
                   SimpleObjectFactory invoked. This method should return 
                   new instance of SimpleCtx.
                5. Verify that the method lookup("there") of the  
                   SimpleCtx invoked. This method should return "Ok".
                6. Verify that the method ctx.lookup("Hello/there") returns "Ok".
                7. Perform above operations with other methods of the 
                   initial context (bind, rebind, unbind etc.).
