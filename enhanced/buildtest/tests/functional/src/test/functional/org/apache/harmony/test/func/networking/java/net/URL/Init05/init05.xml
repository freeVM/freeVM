            <Description>
                        tests that URL constructor creates correct URL object with given 
                        protocol, host, port, file and URLStreamHandler.
                        We use stream handler that extends abstract URLStreamHandler class and implements
                        openConnection() method so that only one permanent connection can be opened indeed. 
                        So all of the connections created using thid handler will have the same URL.
