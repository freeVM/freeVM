            <Description>
The test is against notify1010 method.

For testing purposes two threads are waiting on synchronized "nObjects[1]" object. 
A waiting thread may be waked up with the "nObjects[1].notify" from the main thread,
after that it increments the value of the "nCounts[i]" variable.

The test performs the following checks on the notify1010 method.
1) The method throws "IllegalMonitorStateException"
   if the current thread is not the owner of this object's monitor.
2) The method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
