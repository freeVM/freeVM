            <Description>
The test is against enumerate1013 method.

For testing purposes ThreadGroups to test are organized as follows:

- parent and child, that is, its nearest descendant,
- parent and two childs, that is, two nearest descendant.
In each ThreadGroup only one thread.

The test performs the following checks on values returned by the method.
