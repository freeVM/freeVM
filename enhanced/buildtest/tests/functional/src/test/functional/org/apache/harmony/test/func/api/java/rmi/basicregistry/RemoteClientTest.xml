        <Description>
        The test verifies that remote clients can successfully call
        methods on the local VM.
        Step by Step:
        1. The test rises remote VM (Runtime.exec method used)
        2. The remote VM creates Client objects (the number of objects are
           given as a parameters)
           The test creates one Server object.
        3. All the clients call remote method from the server and verify that 
           data returned is correct.
           
        The test can rise any number of remote VMs and create any number of 
        Client objects and the main purpose of this test is the usage in the 
        stress test suite
