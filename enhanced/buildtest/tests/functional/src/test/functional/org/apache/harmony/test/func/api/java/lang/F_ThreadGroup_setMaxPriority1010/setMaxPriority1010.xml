            <Description>
The test is against setMaxPriority1010 method.

For testing purposes ThreadGroups to test are organized as follows:
- single group,
- parent and child, that is, its nearest descendant,
- parent and two childs, that is, two nearest descendant.
In each ThreadGroup only one thread.

The test performs the following checks on values returned by the method.

1) If Thread.MIN_PRIORITY == Thread.MAX_PRIORITY only simplest check,
   that is, TreadGroup.setMaxPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY) is issued
   and message "ATTENTION: THE TEST IS DEGENERATE" is put into log.
2) After changing priority to lesser value, 
   all threads already having bigger priorities doesn't change these.
3) After changing priority to a lesser value,
   all threads assigned a bigger value get the lesser value.
