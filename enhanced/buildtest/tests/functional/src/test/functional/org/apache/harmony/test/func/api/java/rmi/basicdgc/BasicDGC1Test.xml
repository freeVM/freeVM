    <APITestDescription>

        <Description>
            Name: BasicDGC1Test Purpose: test DGC basic functionality.
            Under test: java.rmi.dgc, RMI runtime

            Test design:

            New VM is started in new thread and next actions are
            performed in it:

            1. Server creates and exports remote object "server" and
            registers it

            2. It's verified that RemoteObject.toStub(server) returns
            stub successfully

            3. The links to server and to the located registry are
            dropped

            4. GC is called

            It is verified after timeout that the thread with that VM is
            not alive
