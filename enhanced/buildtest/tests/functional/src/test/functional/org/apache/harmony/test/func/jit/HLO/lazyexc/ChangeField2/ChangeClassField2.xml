        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if exception object constructor has side-effect.
            Test case details:
            Throws and catches an Exception in a loop, but doesn’t call Exception object in catcher. 
            Exception object constructor has side-effect: static Vector field of the Exception class changes inside. 
            Check that static field is changed; it means Exception object is created, 
            i.e. lazyexc isn’t performed.
