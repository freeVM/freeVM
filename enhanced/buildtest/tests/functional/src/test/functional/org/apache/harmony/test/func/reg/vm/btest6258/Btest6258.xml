        <Description>
            (GC fails to expand heap if allocation size is block size+1 byte)
            The test relies on the default heap sizes -Xms64m -Xmx256m and checks
            if it is possible to allocate 120 Mb in ~124kb blocks.
        Before the issue was fixed, the heap remained at initial size 64 Mb,
        and taking into account ~106% overhead of block store alignment,
            the test used to fail with only ~30 Mb allocated.
            The passing criteria of 120 Mb corresponds to 
            the default maximum heap size 256Mb/2 with some allowance.
