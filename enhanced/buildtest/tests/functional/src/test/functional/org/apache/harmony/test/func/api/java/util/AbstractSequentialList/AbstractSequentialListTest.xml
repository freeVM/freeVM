            <Description>creates a class that extends AbstractSequentialList, 
            rewrites its abstract and protected methods.
            Creates an instance of the subclass and checks if this instance is the
            instance of AbstractSequentialList class.

            <Description>creates a class that extends AbstractSequentialList, 
            and a class that implements ListIterator;
            rewrites their abstract and protected methods.
            Creates an instance of the AbstractSequentialList, calls iterator() method
            and checks if the Iterator works properly (i.e. methods hasNext() and next()
            return right values).
