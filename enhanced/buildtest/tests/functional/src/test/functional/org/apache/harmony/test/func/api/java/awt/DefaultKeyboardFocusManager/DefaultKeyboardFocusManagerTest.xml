            <Description>Instance of a class which is inherited from
             DefaultKeyboardFocusManager is created. After this  the dispatchEvent()
             method is called. 
            </Description>

            <Precondition>Create DefaultKeyboardFocusManager</Precondition>
            <Description>First we find out whether there are available focus
             traversal keys. If we find at least one, we send one event using
             processKeyEvent() to traverse focus forward, and one to traverse focus
             backward

            <Description>We check the returned value of this method. First after trying
             to dispatch the FocusEvent and then KeyEvent. In both cases the return value
             must be true.
