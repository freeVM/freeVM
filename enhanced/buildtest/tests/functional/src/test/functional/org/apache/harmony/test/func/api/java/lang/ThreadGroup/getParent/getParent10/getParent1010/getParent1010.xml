            <Description>
The test is against getParent1010 method.

For testing purposes ThreadGroups to test are organized as follows:
- single group,
- parent and child, that is, its nearest descendant,
- parent and two childs, that is, two nearest descendant.

The test performs the following checks on values returned by the method.
1) Top most parent of any two ThreadGroups is "null".
2) If constructors of two ThreadGroups were supplied with the same parent
   the method returns the same parent for both ThreadGroups,
   that is, p1.equals(p2); otherwise parents are different.
