        <Description>
            1. Create MBean server.

            2. Register HelloMBean with the server.

            3. Add notification listener to the registered MBean with
            String handback object and without notification filter. The
            test class implements NotificationListener, so it is the
            notification listener.

            4. Change Name attribute of the MBean.

            5. Wait until a notification is received.

            6. If the notification has not been received in 3 seconds it
            is considered that the test is failed.

            7. Verify that AttributeChangeNotification object has been
            received.

            8. Verify that received handback object is valid.

            9. Verify that all getters of the received notification
            object return expected values.
