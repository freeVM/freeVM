            <Description>
The test is against hashCode1010 method.

The test performs the following checks on values returned by the method.
1) Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once 
   during an execution of a Java application, 
   the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, 
   provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. 
2) If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method,
   then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects
   must produce the same integer result.
