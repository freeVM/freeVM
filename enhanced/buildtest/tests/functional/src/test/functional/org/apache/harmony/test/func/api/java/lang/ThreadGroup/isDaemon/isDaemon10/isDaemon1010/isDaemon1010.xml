- parent and child, that is, its nearest descendant,
- parent and two childs, that is, two nearest descendant.

The test performs the following checks on values returned by the method.
1) If a ThreadGroup is set to daemon a value is "true" and
   If a ThreadGroup is set not to daemon a value is "false".
2) If only one in all ThreadGroups not set to daemon, is set to daemon,
   all others doesn't change their settings.
