            <Description>
The test is against wait1011 method.

For testing purposes the main thread holding a lock to a monitor object
creates two threads and sequentially starts these.
After getting started, each new thread in indefinitely waits.
Each new thread waits for a predefined time first,
then it interrupts the main thread.

The test performs the following checks on the wait1011 method.
1) The method throws "IllegalMonitorStateException"
   if the current thread is not the owner of this object's monitor.
2) The method throws "IllegalArgumentException"
   if a value of integer argument is negative.
3) The specified amount of real time has elapsed.
4) Some other thread interrupts the current thread.
