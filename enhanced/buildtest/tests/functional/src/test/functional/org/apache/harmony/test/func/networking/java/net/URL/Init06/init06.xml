            <Description>
                        creates URL from some string and uses this URL as Context for the further steps.
                        Creates URL using this Context and the random File.
                        If this File is the empty string, we should get Context as right URL.
                        Othewise this method gets the scheme from the Context (protocol, port, host) 
                        and replaces the File part (if any) with File.
                        Tests if replacement is correct.
