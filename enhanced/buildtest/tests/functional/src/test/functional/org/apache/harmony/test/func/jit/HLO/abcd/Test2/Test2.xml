            Tests redundant array bounds check elimination.
            Test contains a loop which operates with some array elements. 
            Loop control variable is class variable. On the last iteration 
            loop control variable is changed in some method called inside 
            a loop. After that some array element became out of range. Check 
            that ArrayIndexOfBoundExcepton will be thrown in case of index 
            is out of new range.
