        <Description>
            Tests branch simplification pass of JIT compiler.
            Test that such comparisons as var+const1 ~ const2, var-const1 ~ const2 
            aren't simplified to var ~ const1-const2, var ~ const1+const2 if constant
            folding result in overflow or if the constants are floating point types.
