        <Description>
            Tests redundant array bounds check elimination.
            Test contains a loop where an index of array element 
            called inside the loop depends on the loop control variable.
            An overflow occurs on the fourth loop iteration and corrupts 
            the value of loop control variable so that it became negative.
            An array tries to be accessed with an illegal negative index.
            Checks that ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException would be thrown.
