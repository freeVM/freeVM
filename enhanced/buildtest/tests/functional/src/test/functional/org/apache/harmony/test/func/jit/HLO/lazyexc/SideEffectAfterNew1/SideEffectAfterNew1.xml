        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if a compiled method has side effect 
            between 'new' and 'throw' (for the same exception object) statements.
            Test case details:
            Throws and catches an TestException in a loop, but doesnâ€™t call exception object in catcher.
            Calls getMessage() method on the TestException object somewhere between 'new' and 'throw'.
            Store the result of the getMessage() in some local test method variable.
            Checks the value of test variable. 
            If it contains getMessage() execution result on TestException object 
            this means TestException object was created, i.e. lazyexc wasn't performed.
