        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if exception object is used in catch block.
            Test case details:
            Test contains a loop with nested 'try...catch...finally' block.
            TestException throws and catches inside a loop. 
            TestException object stores in internal test method variable in catch clause.
            Test checks in finally clause that this variable contains the TestException object; 
            it means TestException object is created, i.e. lazyexc isnâ€™t performed.
