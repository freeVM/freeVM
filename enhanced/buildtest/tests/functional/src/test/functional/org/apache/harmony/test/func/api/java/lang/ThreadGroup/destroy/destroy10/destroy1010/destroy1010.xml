The test is against destroy1010 method.
For testing purposes ThreadGroups to test are organized in three groups:
- single group,
- parent and child,
- parent and two childs.
The test performs the following checks on ThreadGroups that are not set to daemon.
1) If ThreadGroup has a thread not started yet
   the method results in IllegalThreadStateException.
2) If ThreadGroup has only died threads and its childs are destroyed
   the method does not result in IllegalThreadStateException. 
3) If ThreadGroup is already dstroyed
   the method results in IllegalThreadStateException.
4) If a parent ThreadGroup has only died threads but child(s) has not died yet
   the method results in IllegalThreadStateException.
