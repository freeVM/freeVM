		<Description>
         This test case exercises the JDWP agent when very big number of event
         requests are sent, that should cause only one real event in debuggee 
         but the test should receive very big number of events: one event by one request.
         At first the test sends two sets of event requests: THREAD_START requests
         and THREAD_END request for the same thread in debuggee. After
         thread starts, the test expects to receive all expected THREAD_START events.
         Then, after thread finishes, the test expects to receive all expected 
         THREAD_END events.
