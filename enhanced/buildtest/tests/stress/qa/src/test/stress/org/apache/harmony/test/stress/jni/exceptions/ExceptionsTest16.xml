        <Description>
		Java class fills the memory with some objects and then creates
		a lot of threads. Each thread calls its native method. Native
		method calls itself with CallVoidMethod() JNI function
		specified number of times (enough to cause stack oveflow).
		Then the method	catches StackOverflowError and then raises
		an exception which is caught within the same method.
		Then new exception object is thrown to upper level.
		Parameters:
			-fillMemory - 0 - do not pad memory, 1 - pad memory (1 by default)
			-objsize - size of of objects for padding memory (1000 by default)
			-bufsize - size of buffer to be freed after memory padding (10000 by default)
			-threads - number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - timeout to wait threads to die (ms) (20 minutes by default)
