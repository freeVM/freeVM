        <Description>
		Java class creates a specified number of threads. Each thread
		calls its native method. Native method calls itself
		with Call_Type_Method() JNI function specified number of times
		(enough to cause stack oveflow). Then the method catches
		the StackOverflowError and carries out some calculation
		and returns the result to the top level (Java main method).
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays for calculations (1000 by default)
			-attemtps - Number of native method invocations from Java code (200 by default)
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - Timeout for waiting a thread to die (20 minutes by default)
