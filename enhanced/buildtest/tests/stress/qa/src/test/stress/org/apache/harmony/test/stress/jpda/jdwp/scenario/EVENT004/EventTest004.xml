		<Description>
		 This test case exercises the JDWP agent when very big number of event
		 requests are sent with suspendPolicy = NONE and with 'ThreadOnly'
		 modifier, which cause very big number of asynchronous events in many
		 threads in debuggee. 
		 The tests expects that at once all expected 'METHOD_ENTRY' events
		 and all expected 'METHOD_EXIT' events are received.
