	<Description>
	This test virify that class unloading works correctly.
		Test design for one thread:	
		1.free_memory_before=Runtime.freeMemory()
		2.Each class loader loads a unique class till OutOfMemoryError.
		3.Kill all references to created class loaders.
        4.Invoke gc. 
		5.Verify that all classes should be unloaded:
		   Verify that free_memory_before - Runtime.freeMemory() less then constant

		Test design for many threads:	 
		1.free_memory_before=Runtime.freeMemory()
		2.Each class loader loads a unique class in uniqe thread till OutOfMemoryError.
		3.Kill all references to created class loaders.
        4.Invoke gc. 
		5.Verify that all classes should be unloaded:
		   Verify that free_memory_before - Runtime.freeMemory() less then constant


		Input parameters: Number of loaded classes and memory.
