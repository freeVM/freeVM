		Java class calls its native method. Native method creates
		a lot of huge-length primitive type arrays and calls

		If no crash occures then the test considered to be passed.
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays to be allocated (1000000 by default)
			-maxCnt - Max. number of arrays to be allocated (2000 by default)
