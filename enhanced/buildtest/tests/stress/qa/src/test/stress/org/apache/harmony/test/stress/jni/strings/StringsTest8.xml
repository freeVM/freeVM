		2. do some calculation on current array.
		3. convert current jchar array to java.lang.String
		4. convert Sting object to jchar array and compare
		   with source jchar array.
		5. shift to the next array and go to step 2.
		Parameters:
			-length - Length of strins to be allocated (100000 by default)
			-maxStrCount - Max. number of strings to be allocated (10 by default)
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
