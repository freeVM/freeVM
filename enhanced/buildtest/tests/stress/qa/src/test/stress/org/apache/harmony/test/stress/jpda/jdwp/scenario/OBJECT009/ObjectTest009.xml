		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under ObjectIDs stressing. First
			test generates array of Objects with very large length. Then runs
			<code>ArrayReference.GetValues</code> command for this array, checks and
			saves result. Generates another array of Objects with the same length, but
			with null values, creates memory stressing by loading in memory very big
			array. Runs <code>ArrayReference.SetValues</code> command and fills the
			second array with values from the first array, returned by
			<code>ArrayReference.GetValues</code> command. Checks if both arrays
			contain the same objects.
