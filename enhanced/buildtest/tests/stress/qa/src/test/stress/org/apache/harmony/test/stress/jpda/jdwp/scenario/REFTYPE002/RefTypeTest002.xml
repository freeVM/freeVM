		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under ReferenceTypeIDs stressing.
			First, test loads very big number of classes on debuggee side, sends
			<code>VirtualMachine.AllClasses</code> command, saves and checks returned
			RefTypeIDs. Then, test loads vast number of new classes, sends
			<code>VirtualMachine.AllClasses</code> and compares returned by the second
			AllClasses command RefTypeIDs with RefTypeIDs saved after the first
			AllClasses command. Then test creates memory stressing by loading in memory
			very big array. Then checks if all RefTypeIDs have expected SourceFile and
			signatures.
