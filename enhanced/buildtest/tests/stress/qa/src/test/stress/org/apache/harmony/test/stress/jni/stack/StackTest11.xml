        <Description>
		Java class calls its native method. Native method calls
		specified Java method with Call_Type_Method() JNI function
		specified number of times (enough to cause stack oveflow).
		The Java method calls the native method again. When
		StackOverflowError occurs, the native method catches it
		and carries out some calculation (non-trivial args are
		passed through all the invocations) and returns the result
		to the top level (Java main method).
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays for calculations (7000 by default)
			-attempts - Number of native method invocations from Java code (200 by default)
