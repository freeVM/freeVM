		   or a specific number of references are created.
		After method return it's called again.
		Parameters:
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - Timeout for waiting a thread to die (20 minutes by default)
			-numRefs - Number of references to be created during each
				   native method call (50000000 by default)
			-invCount - Number of native method invocations (20 by default)
