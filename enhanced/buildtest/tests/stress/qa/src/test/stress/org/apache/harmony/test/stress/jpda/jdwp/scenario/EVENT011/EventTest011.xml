		<Description>
     	 This test case exercises the JDWP agent when very big number of event
	     requests for 'METHOD_ENTRY' and 'BREAKPOINT' are sent with 
	     suspendPolicy = EVENT_THREAD and with 'ThreadOnly' modifier, 
	     which cause very big number of asynchronous events in many
	     threads in debuggee.
	     For each thread both 'METHOD_ENTRY' and 'BREAKPOINT' events
	     happen at the same instant of time.   
	     The tests expects that all expected 'METHOD_ENTRY' and 'BREAKPOINT' 
	     events are received.
