        <Description>
		Java class creates a lot of threads. Each thread calls
		the same native method, which carries out following steps:
		1. create a lot of normal-length reference type arrays.
		2. call Java method to do some calculations on current array.
		3. shift to the next array and go to step 2.
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays to be allocated (10000 by default)
			-maxCnt - Max. number of arrays to be allocated (2000 by default)
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - Timeout to wait threads to die (20 minutes by default)
