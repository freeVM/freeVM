		<Description>
         This test case exercises the JDWP agent when very big number of event
         requests for THREAD_START event are sent.
         The stage 1:
          - Debuggee - creates some 'tested' threads.
          - Test - sends requests for THREAD_START events for 'checked' threads,
            which are the part of all 'tested' threads. For each 'checked' thread
            big number of requests are sent.
          - Debuggee - starts all 'tested' threads.
          - Test - checks that all expected THREAD_START events for all requests
            are received from JDWP agent: for each 'checked' thread big number
            of THREAD_START events should be received. No any THREAD_START event 
            should be received for 'tested' threads, for which requests were not sent. 
          - Test - clear all requests for THREAD_START events for all 'checked' threads.
         The stage 2:
          - Debuggee - finishes all 'tested' threads and creates them again.
          - Test - sends requests for THREAD_START events for all 'checked' threads,
            then cleares all sent requests for the some part of 'checked' threads.
          - Debuggee - starts all 'tested' threads.
          - Test - checks that only expected THREAD_START events for all active requests
            are received from JDWP agent.
          - Test - clear all active requests for THREAD_START events.
         The stage 3:
          - Debuggee - finishes all 'tested' threads and creates them again.
          - Test - sends requests for THREAD_START events for all 'checked' threads,
            then cleares all sent requests for all 'checked' threads.
          - Debuggee - starts all 'tested' threads.
          - Test - checks that no any events except VM_DEATH event
            are received from JDWP agent.
