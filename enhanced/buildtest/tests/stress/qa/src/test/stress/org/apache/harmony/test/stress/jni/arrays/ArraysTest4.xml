        <Description>
		Java class creates a lot of threads. Each thread calls
		the same native method, which carries out following steps:
		1. create a lot of huge-length primitive type arrays.
		2. do some calculation on current array.
		3. call Java method on this array.
		4. compare returned array with source array.
		5. shift to the next array and go to step 2.
		Parameters:
			-arrSize - Length of arrays to be allocated (1000000 by default)
			-maxCnt - Max. number of arrays to be allocated (20 by default)
			-threads - Number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - Timeout to wait threads to die (ms) (20 minutes by default)
