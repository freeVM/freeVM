		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under ObjectIDs stressing. First
			test runs <code>VirtualMachine.AllThreads</code> command, creates separate
			thread and run it vast number of time, runs
			<code>VirtualMachine.AllThreads</code> command again, checks number of
			running threads. Then it runs <code>VirtualMachine.DisposeObjects</code>
			and disposes all ThreadIDs. For each thread test checks
			ReferenceType, Name, and Status, and expects proper number of
			INVALID_OBJECTID errors.
