		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under Thread and ObjectIDs
			stressing. First, test generates array of Objects with very large length,
			creates separate thread and starts it vast number of times. Each created
			thread is suspended on proper event, test sends
			<code>ClassType.InvokeMethod</code> command for <code>methodToInvoke</code>
			method without waiting a reply. Then test runs
			<code>ArrayReference.GetValues</code> command for created array of Objects,
			saves and checks returned values. Then generates another array with the same
			length but with null values, runs <code>ArrayReference.SetValues</code> and
			fills the second array with values from the first array. Checks if both
			arrays contains the same objects. Then checks replies for each
			<code>ClassType.InvokeMethod</code> command.
