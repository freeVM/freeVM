		<Description>
		 This test case exercises the JDWP agent when very big number of event
		 requests are sent with suspendPolicy = EVENT_THREAD and with 'ThreadOnly'
		 modifier, which cause very big number of asynchronous events in many
		 threads in debuggee.
		 For each thread many requests are sent so many corresponding events
		 with different request IDs should be sent to debugger although in fact
		 only one 'METHOD_ENTRY' event and one 'METHOD_EXIT' event happen for 
		 each thread. 
	     Before each thread enters in test method to cause expected events
    	 the debuggee creates memory stress until OutOfMemory happens.
		 The tests expects that at first all expected 'METHOD_ENTRY' events are
		 received and then after each thread is resumed all expected 
		 'METHOD_EXIT' events are received.
