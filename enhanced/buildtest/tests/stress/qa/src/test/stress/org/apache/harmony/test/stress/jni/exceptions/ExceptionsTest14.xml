        <Description>
		Java class fill memory with some objects. Then it creates
		a lot of threads. Each thread calls its native method.
		Native method calls itself with CallVoidMethod() JNI function
		specified number of times (not so much times to cause
		stack oveflow). Then the method	raises an exception which is
		caught within the same method. Then new exception object
		is thrown to upper level.
		Parameters:
			-depth - recursion depth (100 by default)
			-fillMemory - 0 - do not pad memory, 1 - pad memory (1 by default)
			-objsize - size of of objects for padding memory (1000 by default)
			-bufsize - size of buffer to be freed after memory padding (10000 by default)
			-threads - number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - timeout to wait threads to die (ms) (20 minutes by default)
