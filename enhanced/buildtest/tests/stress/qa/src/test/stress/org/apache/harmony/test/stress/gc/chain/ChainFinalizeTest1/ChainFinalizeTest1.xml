        	<Description>
                    Allocate memory by chain objects: each object of the class contains reference to the same class and to bytes array. Also finalize() function is defined for the objects. Allocation is performed in double loop. Inner loop contains allocation of this chain, also it is taken in the account that total size of the chain does not reach heap limit. At the end of the inner loop the head of the chain is assigned to null and GC is called explicitly.  Check if OutOfMemoryError not thrown. Check if finalize() is invoked.
