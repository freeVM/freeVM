  <Description>This test is intended to check if the implementation
  of VM supports atomic access to 64-bit numbers (long and double).
  Several threads are created. Each of them infinitely modifies
  long and double variables giving them a value from a predefined
  set. The main thread checks if values of the variables are in
  this set or not. If not, the test fails.</Description>
