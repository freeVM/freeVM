		<Description>
            This tests case exercises the JDWP agent under ReferenceTypeIDs
			stressing. First, test loads very big number of classes on debuggee side,
			sends <code>VirtualMachine.AllClasses</code> command, saves and checks
			returned RefTypeIDs. Then, test loads some number of new classes, sends
			<code>VirtualMachine.ClassesBySignature</code> and checks that RefTypeIDs of new classes are unique.
			Then checks if all RefTypeIDs have expected SourceFile and signatures.
