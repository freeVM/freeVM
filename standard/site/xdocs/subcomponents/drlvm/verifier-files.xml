<section name="Verifier directories and source files">
<p>
There are three basic functionalities in the verifier lib: Java5-style verification, Java6-style verification and 
extension for recomputing stackmaptable attribute.
</p>
<p>
The files are located in four folders in verifier-3363:
base/, java5/, java6/, and x_verifier/.
base folder contains common files, other folders contain files specific for corresponding functionalities.
</p>
<p>
base/ folder contains files with "_base" in their names, with "_x" in their names as well as other classes.
Files with _base in their names contain base functionality Java5- and Java6-specific classes 
defined in the java5/ and java6/ folders. These files contain functions that are exactly the same for Java5 and Java6 
verification. 
<br/>
Files with _x in their names contain template classes that define functions that manipulate different types of data 
but in the same way for both Java5 and Java6 verification. Template classes extend base classes, classes in folders 
Java5 and Java6 in their turn extend template classes.
<br/>
Other classes define either utility functions or contain implementations for verifier's interface functions (like ver.cpp).
</p>
<p>
x_verifier/ folder contains code necessary for computing stackmaptable attribute.
