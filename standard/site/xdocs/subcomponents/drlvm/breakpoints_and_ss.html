<h1>Implementation of breakpoints and single step in JIT mode</h1>
<a name="breakpoints"><h2>Breakpoints</h2></a>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>DRLVM uses code instrumentation to set breakpoints in a
method in the JIT mode. When JVMTI is turned on by a command line switch, only
Jitrino.JET is used to compile methods. JET maintains one-to-one mapping
between method bytecodes and native code instructions, so that for each
bytecode it is possible to find the instruction starting address, and for each
address in compiled code it is possible to determine the corresponding
bytecode. Using this mapping you can to set a breakpoint in any point of a
method and notify the agent when execution reaches this point.</p>
<p>DRLVM has an abstraction layer, class VMBreakPoints, that
allows the following interfaces to register breakpoints in the registry:
thread-local single-stepping, breakpoints in the interpreter mode and in
native Java code for NCAI. This way, each breakpoints interface uses its
specific processing callback that it gives to the breakpoints registry. Each
interface maintains a list of references to the global list of currently
enabled breakpoints. This list has a global synchronization lock to maintain
its integrity.</p>
<p>Each interface has a priority, and breakpoints are processed
in the order of interfaces' priority. Prioritizing is necessary because the
same location may have multiple breakpoints registered by different
interfaces. The JVMTI specification states that for the same location in the
code, single-step events have to be sent before breakpoints event, so the
single-step interface has a higher priority than the breakpoints
interface.</p>
<h3>Setting a breakpoint</h3>
<p>To implement the JVMTI API function SetBreakpoint, DRLVM uses
the global interface registered in the breakpoints registry and the JVMTI
breakpoints interface. First, the code locks the list, checks if a reference
with the same method and bytecode location has been already registered, and if
not, adds a new one.</p>
<p>When a new reference to a breakpoint is added, the breakpoint
registry has to instrument the code. In the interpreter mode, it uses the
interpreter internal function for this, and in the JIT mode, the registry uses
JET to find out the native address for the requested bytecode. This address is
instrumented with a single byte instruction, such as INT3 (used on Linux* OS)
or CLI (used on Windows* OS). Instrumentation is done by remembering the byte
that was previously in memory at the target address and then writing the
single byte opcode into memory. Because instrumentation is done when the
thread owns the global breakpoints lock, atomic operations are
unnecessary.</p>
<p>After a new reference to a breakpoint is added, the global
breakpoints list lock is released.</p>
<p>There is a possible situation that a method where user wants
to set a breakpoint is not compiled yet. The method may be loaded into memory
by the class loader, but not executed a single time, so there is no native
code generated for it. To set a breakpoint it such a method, breakpoints
registry adds a breakpoint to a list of pending breakpoints. Each method has a
pointer to such a list, which is initialized with NULL. For each method after
VM calls the compilation, and if it is successful, VM checks this list, and if
it is not empty it performs all the instrumentation.</p>
<h3>Clearing a breakpoint</h3>
<p>To implement JVMTI API function ClearBreakpoint, DRLVM uses
the same global JVMTI breakpoints interface. For that, the code locks the
global breakpoints list and tries to find a reference to a breakpoint for the
requested method and bytecode location. If no reference is found, an error is
returned. If the reference is found, the code calls the breakpoints registry
to remove it.</p>
<p>When a reference to a breakpoint is removed, the breakpoints
registry checks all registered interfaces and their references to find any
other existing references to the same breakpoint. If no references are found,
the location in the code is de-instrumented: in the interpreter mode
breakpoints registry uses interpreter function, and in the JIT mode - by
writing the original saved byte back to the memory to restore the original
instruction. If the target method where breakpoint is removed has not been
compiled yet, the breakpoint is removed from its list of pending
breakpoints.</p>
<p>After a reference to a breakpoint is removed, the global
breakpoints list lock is released.</p>
<h3>Reacting to a breakpoint</h3>
<p>In the JIT mode when execution reaches instrumented location,
the Java process receives a signal (exception on Windows). Signals in DRLVM
are handled by the <a href="crash_handler.html">crash handler</a>. VM registers a signal callback for the
breakpoint type signal so that it can react to it. This callback calls the
breakpoints registry to process the breakpoint.</p>
<p>The registry processes all registered interfaces in the order
of their priority. If an interface has a registered reference to the
breakpoint at the address where the signal has been received, the breakpoints
registry calls this interface's callback. In this callback, normal event JVMTI
processing is done. For each JVMTI environment that has enabled receiving
interface-specific event type (e.g. JVMTI_BREAKPOINT or JVMIT_SINGLE_STEP),
this environment's callback is called.</p>
<p>Before calling the callback, the registry unlocks the global
list of breakpoints. Unlocking is necessary because the callback executes
arbitrary JVMTI agent code that may work for a long time (e.g. wait on a JVMTI
raw monitor). At the same time, another thread may need to modify the
breakpoints list, and if at the same time this thread owns the same raw
monitor, the VM process would dead lock.</p>
<p>After all of the interface's callbacks are called, it is
necessary to return to executing the code of the method starting with the
instruction that is instrumented. However, it is not possible to remove
instrumentation from this instruction because another thread may be executing
the same code at the same time, and with removed instrumentation the other
thread would not receive the breakpoint signal.</p>
<p>To execute the original instruction, JVMTI has a thread-local
memory buffer where this instruction is copied to. To copy this instruction,
the breakpoints registry code uses a simple disassembler, which parses a
single instruction and determines its length. The registry copies the original
instrumented byte and the rest of the instruction into this thread-local
buffer and after it inserts a jump instruction to the address next to the
instrumented instruction.</p>
<p>NOTE: On x86_64 platforms, it is impossible to create a jump
to a 64-bit address in the instruction's immediate operand. So instead of a
jump, a sequence of push and ret instructions is used. It is necessary because
no registers can be modified while executing the code emulating the original
instruction.</p>
<p>Certain instructions depend on their location in the memory,
such as relative jumps and calls. These instructions are handled in a specific
way: for relative jumps the generated code contains a jump to an absolute
address, for calls the generated sequence consists of pushing the "return
address", which is the original address of the instrumented call instruction,
and jumping to the calculated absolute target address.</p>
<p>After creating the buffer with the code emulating the
behavior of the instrumented instruction, the breakpoints processing code
modifies the registers' context to make the IP pointer to point to this
buffer. With such modified registers context, the breakpoint processing code
returns to the crash handler, which transfers execution control to the
thread-local buffer.</p>
<h2>Single step</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The single-step mode implements Step In and Step Over
commands in the debugger. In this mode, for each executed bytecode VM must
send an event to the JVMTI agent with method and location in the method
parameters. The agent may request to receive this event only on a specific set
of threads or globally for all of executed threads.</p>
<p>Single stepping in DRLVM is done with breakpoints.
Breakpoints are set on bytecodes and after sending the event to the agent,
breakpoints are moved to the next bytecodes. Each thread in single-step mode
uses its own breakpoints interface to add and remove single-step breakpoints.
These interfaces have priority of single-step, that is higher than priority of
ordinary breakpoints.</p>
<h3>Enabling single step</h3>
<p>When the JVMTI agent enables the single-step mode, DRLVM
suspends all target threads except current. If the agent enables the single
step globally, all currently running threads are considered target threads. In
all target threads, VM creates a thread-local single step state, which is a
breakpoint interface registered in the breakpoints registry with type "single
step". Presence of this single-step state means that single step is enabled in
the thread and is often used as a flag in the code.</p>
<p>For each thread, JVMTI code determines the execution
position. If the thread executes Java code, the currently executed bytecode is
the starting bytecode. If the thread executes native code, no action is taken.
For every starting bytecode, JVMTI code determines the bytecode next to it and
sets a breakpoint of single step type on it. These breakpoints are kept in the
single-step state.</p>
<p>After setting breakpoints in all threads that execute Java
code, DRLVM resumes all threads.</p>
<h3>Disabling single step</h3>
<p>When the agent disables the single-step mode, threads are
suspended as with enabling this mode. In each thread, VM uses the single step
state to remove references to the single step breakpoints, de-allocates the
single-step state and resumes target threads.</p>
<h3>Processing single step</h3>
<p>The single step breakpoints interface has its own breakpoint
processing callback different from the callback for ordinary breakpoints. In
this callback, VM sends single-step events to the agent's environments that
have requested to receive such events. Environment callbacks are called in the
same way as for other JVMTI events.</p>
<p>If after all callbacks are called, the agent hasn't turned
off the single-step mode in the thread, JVMTI has to continue executing to the
next bytecode. It does the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Removes all breakpoints predicted for the current thread
      - they were used on the previous step.
    <li>
      Depending on the currently executed bytecode, predicts
        which bytecode(s) may be executed next to it.
      <ol>
        <li>
          For ordinary bytecodes that don't transfer execution control the
            next bytecode is the one next to the current one in the method's
            bytecode array.
          <li>
            For bytecodes that transfer control, all of the
              possible target locations are counted as predicted
              locations.
      </ol>
</ol>
<p>JVMTI code doesn't try to interpret the Java state and
determine which target location is going to take place when the bytecode is
executed. Instead, JVMTI does the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
      For bytecodes like tableswitch and conditional
        branches, JVMTI adds all its targets to the predicted bytecodes
        list.
    <li>
      For invokestatic and invokespecial bytecodes, the
        target bytecode is the 1<sup>st</sup> bytecode of the method that they
        invoke.
      <li>
        For invokevirtual and invokeinterface, JVMTI does
          special handling (<a href="#invoke">see below</a>).
</ul>
<p>If the target method is not compiled yet, single-step
breakpoints are added to its list of pending breakpoints in the same way as
described in the <a href="#breakpoints">Breakpoints</a> section.</p>
<p>After predicting all possible target locations JVMTI code
sets single step breakpoints on them. When this is done, execution is returned
back to the code breakpoints registry which in turn returns execution back to
the java method in the way described in breakpoints section.</p>
<h3>Transitions from Java to native and back</h3>
<p>Native code may be a user-program native method or VM code,
such as class loader, that calls the Java user class loader to load classes.
When native code calls a Java method, and if a thread has the single-step mode
enabled, the first bytecode of the Java method is counted as predicted, and VM
code sets the single-step breakpoint there.</p>
<p>If the single-step state is present when the execution
returns to VM from the Java method, VM tries to find a Java method up the
stack which has invoked the native code. It may happen implicitly with invoke
or explicitly when compiled code calls VM to resolve a method. The bytecode
next to the location which has called native code is counted predicted and VM
code sets the single step breakpoint there.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>When an exception is raised, all single-step predicted
breakpoints are removed because execution control may not reach them. VM tries
to find the exception handler code. If a Java exception handler is found, its
starting IP location is counted as predicted and VM sets a single-step
breakpoint on it. If the exception handler is not found, or a native method is
reached in stack unwinding, no predicted breakpoint is set. Single-stepping in
native code is not possible, and the predicted breakpoint would be set
automatically when native code returns to Java as described in the previous
section.</p>
<a name="invoke"><h3>Invokevirtual and invokeinterface</h3></a>
<p>The two bytecodes that transfer control have no fixed target
address that could be found by analyzing the code statically. Instead, the
target address can be found at run time. When VM sends a single-step event and
execution is stopped on invokevirtual or invokeinterface bytecode, VM inserts
a special single-step type breakpoint (it has a flag to make it different from
ordinary single-step breakpoints) that doesn't trigger a single-step
event.</p>
<p>The location of such a breakpoint is determined in a special
way. Compiled code for invokevirtual and invokeinterface bytecodes may be long
and may contain several call instructions before the actual call of the target
method. But there is a special contract with JIT that the last call inside of
the code range that corresponds to the invoke bytecode is the actual call of
the method. So VM tries to find this last call instruction in the code range
and instrument it with the special type of single step breakpoint.</p>
<p>To find this last call instruction, VM uses the same
disassembler facility that is used for processing breakpoints. It iterates
through all instructions of the code generated for the invoke type bytecode
and checks whether the instruction is a call. Iteration continues until the
whole range of code for the invoke bytecode is scanned. The last call
encountered in this range is the one that calls the method.</p>
<p>When a special type of single step breakpoint is hit, the
register context contains all runtime information to find the target address.
VM uses the call instruction argument to find the target address of the call.
It looks up the method in the compiled methods table and if such method is
found, counts its first bytecode as predicted. If no method is found, this
means that the method is not compiled yet and no action is taken.</p>
<p>Single-step breakpoints for newly compiled methods are set
after they are compiled, at the same time when pending breakpoints are
inserted, as described in breakpoints section. For every method that is
compiled, its first bytecode is considered as predicted, and VM sets a
single-step type breakpoint on it.</p></body>
