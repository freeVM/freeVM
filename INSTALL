Installation instructions for the JC virtual machine:

0. Install these support software packages if not already installed
   on your machine:

    libpopt:
	ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/rpm-4.0.x/popt-1.6.4.tar.gz
	FreeBSD: devel/popt
	Debian: libpopt-dev
	RPM: popt-devel

    libz:
	http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
	Should come installed with FreeBSD.
	Debian: zlib1g-dev
	RPM: zlib

1. Install classpath-0.20. You can get it from

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/classpath/classpath-0.20.tar.gz
	FreeBSD: java/classpath
	Debian: classpath

   If you want/need to build and install Classpath manually, first
   install jikes (preferably version 1.22):

	ftp://www-126.ibm.com/pub/jikes/1.22/jikes-1.22.tar.gz
	FreeBSD: java/jikes
	Debian: jikes
	PRM: jikes

   Then:

	$ ./configure --enable-jni --with-jikes
	$ gmake
	$ gmake install

   NOTE: you should add the "--disable-gtk-peer" flag to configure if you
   don't have the required GTK stuff installed on your machine.

   NOTE: Classpath requires GNU make to build.

2. Build and install JC via these commands:

	$ ./configure --with-classpath=DIR
	$ make
	$ make install

   where DIR is the Classpath is install location, i.e., the --prefix
   you configured Classpath with (if any). Classpath's default prefix is
   /usr/local/classpath, but packaging systems often change this. E.g.,
   on Debian, if using the classpath package, use "--with-classpath=/usr".

3. Create your personalized .jc startup file:

	$ printf "# JC defaults\n\nverbose=gc,gen\n\n" > ~/.jc

   This example turns on verbose output for code generation and garbage
   collection.

4. You're ready to go!

	$ jc --help

   Online documentation is available in info format (installed in the
   usual place) or HTML format (PREFIX/share/jc/doc/jc.html). There
   is also a man page, jc(1).
