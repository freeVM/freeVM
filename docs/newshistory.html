        <dt>Microemulator code contribution</dt>
        <dd>
          Apache Harmony has broadened it's scope of code implementing the Java
          platform APIs with the acceptance of a substantial code contribution
          from the authors of Microemulator.
          <p />
          Microemulator is a pure Java implementation of Java ME APIs in Java SE.  With
          the emulator code it becomes possible to run MIDlet (MIDP/CLDC) based
          applications as a standalone Java application or as web browser applet.
          <p />
          Thanks to Bartek, Vlad, and Michael for this contribution to Apache Harmony!

          an innovative fast byte code verifier, lazy resolution in all JIT
          modes on IA32 platforms, support for Java6.0 classes in DRLVM.<p />
          Other areas that were improved include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bytecode mapping in JIT - exception stack traces became more
              comprehensive
            </li>
            <li>
              Threading support was partially re-factored towards improvement
              of reliability and maintainability

          license, this not only demonstrates the portability of the
          <a href="subcomponents/classlibrary/index.html">Apache Harmony class library</a>,
          it also adds a valuable tool to help us as we continue building our independent implementation
