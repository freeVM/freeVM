Due to the oversight which we wish to provide for the Harmony community, the following 
process will be used for committers, contributors and their contributions.
</p>

  at all experience levels and interests, but at the same time will work to 
  minimze any risks to the the ASF, the project and our community  due to 
  inappropriate contributions of the intellectual property of others.
</li>
<li>
   We will adhere to the standard Apache process and contribution agreements, but 
   enhance to gather information about contributor's previous experience with
   similar technology.  This information will be used to ensure that the work
   contributed to the project does not infringe the intellectual or other
   property rights of others. 
</li>
<li>
   We will compartmentalize our SVN repository and use fine-grained access control
   to ensure broad participation while still ensuring that inappropriate or 
   questionalble contributions do no occur.
</li>
<li>
  We will require every contributor to fill out a "Authorized Contributor Questionnaire", 
  while will be used to help limit the risks to our source base from inappropriate 
  contributions.

We shall divide our SVN repository into sections.  There will be two 
main sections, the "standard" section, for which the standard Apache process 
applies (namely, the standard Apache ICLA is all that is required)
and the "enhanced" section, which requires any committer to also be 
an Authorized Contributor.  Project code will be in the "enhanced" section, 
and website, documentation and other miscellany will be in the "standard"
section.  For the purposes of illustration :
</p>
                                                <pre>

enhanced/JVM
          /VM
          /JIT
          /GC
          /...
          / vm/lib interface
enhanced/classlib
            /applet
            /awt
            /beans
            /...
standard/website and Documentation
standard/Legal and administrative

</pre>
                                                <p>
and we limit access within the enhanced part of the SVN 
using information provided by Authorized Contributor, as defined below.
Access will be controlled with fine-grained access control lists.
</p>
                                                <p>
We will be as liberal as possible - if your status as an Authorized Contributor doesn't prevent it,
access should be granted to any part of the SVN repository.

Committers can only commit contributions to the repositories 
that they personally created <i>specifically for contribution to Apache Harmony.</i>
This is the standard stream of fresh original work, small enhancements 
and patches that are the normal flow of project life.  The purpose of 
this rule is to explicitly prohibit re-purposed "bulk" code 
that the contributor believes is their original work from being
added to the codebase without explicit oversight and acceptance. 
We can still accept contributions like that, but will track them explicitly
as Bulk Contributions.

Harmony PMC.

                                                <p>
We encourage every committer, if appropriate, to have their employer execute a 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache Corporate Contributor License Agreement</a>.
Note that this is recommended, but not required.

Any software or other contribution that was not created explicitly for 
Apache Harmony <i>in</i> the Apache Harmony project is considered to
be a 'Bulk Contribution'.  This status is independent of the purpose
or author of said contribution.  For example:
</p>
                                                <ul>
<li> Personal utilities that a committer always uses on projects</li>
<li> Code from other open source projects that have a compatible license</li>
<li> Code from proprietary projects for which the donor has clear title</li>
</ul>
                                                <p>
Any Bulk Contribution  :
</p>
                                                <ol>
<li> Will be donated via the project JIRA as a contribution under the Apache License.</li>
<li> Will be accompanied by a Software Grant or CCLA which will be registered with the Apache Incubator</li>
<li> Will be registered in the Apache Harmony Bulk Contribution Repository
      via a <a href="bulk_contribution_checklist.html">Bulk Contribution Checklist</a></li>
<li> Will be made by an Authorized Contributor </li>
</ol>
                                                <p>
The Bulk Contribution Repository is a separate place in our administrative SVN in which each contribution 
is committed, in it's entirety, before being combined with the project codebases.  We do this to
ensure that we have a clear and unambiguous record of any repurposed software that was contributed or
brought into the project source tree. Along with the source or other contributed materials, the 
contribution will also include a description of the software and the name of the Authorized Contributor
that made the donation
</p>
                                                <p>
We strongly urge any potential contributor to carefully examine their candidate for contribution
before offering to the project.  To that end, we have started collecting information on tools and
other aids to help in this process, and it can be found <a href="code_scan_tools.html">here</a>.
