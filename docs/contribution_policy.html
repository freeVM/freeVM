Due to the oversight which we wish to provide for the Harmony community, the following

  at all experience levels and interests, but at the same time we are working to 
  minimize any risks to the ASF, the project and our community due to 
  inappropriate contributions of the intellectual property of others.
</li>
<li>
   We adhere to the standard Apache process and contribution agreements, and 
   enhance them to gather information about contributor's previous experience with
   similar technology.  This information is used to ensure that the work
   contributed to the project does not infringe the intellectual or other
   property rights of others. 
</li>
<li>
   We have compartmentalized our repository and use fine-grained access control
   to ensure broad participation while still ensuring that inappropriate or 
   questionable contributions do no occur.
</li>
<li>
  We require every contributor to fill out an
  <a href="auth_cont_quest.html">Authorized Contributor Questionnaire</a>, 
  which is used to help limit the risks to our source base from inappropriate 
  contributions.

  We have divided our Subversion(SVN) repository into sections.  There are two 
  main sections, the "standard" section, for which the standard Apache process 
  applies (namely, the standard 
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">Apache ICLA</a>
  is all that is required) and the "enhanced" section, which requires any
  committer to also be an Authorized Contributor.  Project code is in the
  "enhanced" section, and website, documentation and other miscellany is in
  the "standard" section.  For the purposes of illustration :
</p>
                                                <pre>

  and we limit access within the enhanced part of the SVN 
  using information provided by Authorized Contributors, as defined below.
  Access to different parts of the repository is controlled by fine-grained
  access control lists.
</p>
                                                <p>
  We will be as liberal as possible - if your status as an Authorized Contributor
  doesn't prevent it, access should be granted to any part of the SVN repository.

Committers can only commit contributions to the repositories 
that they personally created <i>specifically for contribution to Apache Harmony.</i>
This is the standard stream of fresh original work, small enhancements 
and patches that are the normal flow of project life.
</p>
                                                <p>
The purpose of 
this rule is to explicitly prohibit re-purposed "bulk" code 
that the contributor believes is their original work from being
added to the codebase without explicit oversight and acceptance. 
We can still accept contributions like that, but will track them explicitly
as Bulk Contributions.

Any software or other contribution that was not created explicitly for 
Apache Harmony <i>in</i> the Apache Harmony project is considered to
be a 'Bulk Contribution'.  This status is independent of the purpose
or author of said contribution.  For example:
</p>
                                                <ul>
<li> Personal utilities that a committer always uses on projects</li>
<li> Code from other open source projects that have a compatible license</li>
<li> Code from proprietary projects for which the donor has clear title</li>
</ul>
                                                <p>
Any Bulk Contribution  :
</p>
                                                <ol>
<li> Will be donated via the project bug tracking system (JIRA) as a contribution under the Apache License.</li>
<li> Will be accompanied by a Software Grant or CCLA which will be registered with the Apache Incubator</li>
<li> Will be registered in the Apache Harmony Bulk Contribution Repository
      via a <a href="bulk_contribution_checklist.html">Bulk Contribution Checklist</a></li>
<li> Will be made by an Authorized Contributor to Harmony (defined above)</li>
</ol>
                                                <p>
The Bulk Contribution Repository is a separate place in our administrative SVN in which each contribution 
is committed, in it's entirety, before being combined with the project codebases.  We do this to
ensure that we have a clear and unambiguous record of any repurposed software that was contributed or
brought into the project source tree. Along with the source or other contributed materials, the 
contribution will also include a description of the software and the name of the Authorized Contributor
that made the donation.
</p>
                                                <p>
We strongly urge any potential contributor to carefully examine their candidate for contribution
before offering to the project.  To that end, we have started collecting information on tools and
other aids to help in this process, and it can be found <a href="code_scan_tools.html">here</a>.
