    </h1>
                        <p>
        This document defines the guidelines for the
        <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/">Apache Harmony Project</a>.
        It includes definitions of how conflict is resolved by voting,
        who is able to vote, and the procedures to follow for proposing and
        making changes to the Apache products.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The objective here is to avoid unnecessary conflict over changes and
        continue to produce a quality system in a timely manner. Not all conflict
        can be avoided, but at least we can agree on the procedures for conflict
        to be resolved.
      </p>
                                    
    <h2>
        <a name="Voting">Voting</a>
    </h2>
      
                        <p>
        Any of the Apache Developers may vote on any issue or action item.
        However, the only binding votes are those cast by active members of the
        Apache Harmony PMC; if the vote is about a change to source code or
        documentation, the primary author of what is being changed may also
        cast a binding vote on that issue. All other votes are non-binding.
        All developers are encouraged to participate in decisions, but the
        decision itself is made by those who have been long-time contributors
        to the project. In other words, the Apache Harmony Project is a
        minimum-threshold meritocracy.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The act of voting carries certain obligations -- voting members are
        not only stating their opinion, they are agreeing to help do the work of
        the Apache Harmony Project. Since we are all volunteers, members often become
        inactive for periods of time in order to take care of their "real jobs"
        or devote more time to other projects. It is therefore unlikely that the
        entire group membership will vote on every issue. To account for this,
        all voting decisions are based on a minimum quorum.
      </p>
                                <p>Each vote can be made in one of three flavors:</p>
                                <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong>+1</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Yes, agree, or the action should be performed. On some issues, this
          vote is only binding if the voter has tested the action on
          their own system(s).
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>0</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Abstain, no opinion, or I am happy to let the other group members
          decide this issue. An abstention may have detrimental effects if
          too many people abstain.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>-1</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          No. On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a
          <strong>veto</strong>. All vetos must include an explanation of
          why the veto is appropriate. A veto with no explanation is void.
          No veto can be overruled. If you disagree with the veto, you
          should lobby the person who cast the veto. Voters intending to veto
          an action item should make their opinions known to the group immediately,
          so that the problem can be remedied as early as possible.
        </dd>
      </dl>
                                <p>
        An action item requiring <em>consensus approval</em> must receive
        at least <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and <strong>no vetos</strong>.
        An action item requiring <em>majority approval</em> must receive
        at least <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and more <strong>+1</strong>
        votes than <strong>-1</strong> votes (<em>i.e.</em>, a majority with a minimum
        quorum of three positive votes). All other action items are considered
        to have <em>lazy approval</em> until someone votes <strong>-1</strong>,
        after which point they are decided by either consensus or a majority vote,
        depending upon the type of action item.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Votes are tallied within the STATUS file, adjacent to the action
        item under vote. All votes must be sent to the mailing list.
      </p>

          <strong>Long Term Plans</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Long term plans are simply announcements that group members
          are working on particular issues related to the Apache software.
          These are not voted on,
          but group members who do not agree with a particular plan,
          or think an alternate plan would be better, are obligated to
          inform the group of their feelings. In general, it is always
          better to hear about alternate plans <strong>prior</strong> to
          spending time on less adequate solutions.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <strong>Short Term Plans</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Short term plans are announcements that a developer is working on
          a particular set of documentation or code files, with the implication
          that other developers should avoid them or try to coordinate their
          changes. This is a good way to proactively avoid conflict and
          possible duplication of work.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <strong>Release Plan</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A release plan is used to keep all the developers aware of when a
          release is desired, who will be the release manager, when the
          repository will be frozen in order to create the release, and
          assorted other trivia to keep us from tripping over ourselves
          during the final moments. Lazy majority decides each issue in
          the release plan.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <strong>Release Testing</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          After a new release is built, colloquially termed a tarball, it
          must be tested before being released to the public. Majority
          approval is required before the tarball can be publically released.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <strong>Showstoppers</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Showstoppers are issues that require a fix be in place
          before the next public release. They are listed in the STATUS file
          in order to focus special attention on the problem. An issue becomes
          a showstopper when it is listed as such in STATUS and remains
          so by lazy consensus.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <strong>Product Changes</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Changes to the Apache products, including code and documentation,
          will appear as action items under several categories corresponding
          to the change status:
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <strong>concept/plan</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              An idea or plan for a change. These are usually only listed in
              STATUS when the change is substantial, significantly impacts the
              API, or is likely to be controversial. Votes are being requested
              early so as to uncover conflicts before too much work is done.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <strong>proposed patch</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A specific set of changes to the current product in the form
              of <a href="#Patch Format">input to the patch command</a> (a diff output).
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <strong>committed change</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A one-line summary of a change that has been committed to the
              repository since the last public release.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            All product changes to the currently active repository are subject
            to lazy consensus. All product changes to a prior-branch (old version)
            repository require consensus before the change is committed.
          </p>

      </dl>

                        <p>
        Ideas must be review-then-commit; patches can be commit-then-review.
        With a commit-then-review process, we trust that the developer doing the
        commit has a high degree of confidence in the change. Doubtful changes,
        new features, and large-scale overhauls need to be discussed before
        being committed to a repository. Any major change
        must receive consensus approval on the mailing list before being committed.
        For detailed instructions on reporting, resolving and closing issues, refer to
        <a href="issue_resolution_guideline.html">Good Issue Resolution Guideline</a>.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Each developer is responsible for notifying the mailing list and
        adding an action item to STATUS when they have an idea for a new feature
        or major change to propose for the product. The distributed nature of the
        Apache project requires an advance notice of 48 hours in order to properly
        review a major change -- consensus approval of either the concept or a
        specific patch is required before the change can be committed. Note that
        a committer might veto the concept (with an adequate explanation), but later
        rescind that veto if a specific patch satisfies their objections.
        No advance notice is required to commit singular bug fixes.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Related changes should be committed as a group, or very closely
        together. Half-completed projects should not be committed unless
        doing so is necessary to pass the baton to another developer who has
        agreed to complete the project in short order. All code changes must
        be successfully compiled on the developer's platform before being
        committed.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The current source code tree should be capable of complete compilation
        at all times. However, it is sometimes impossible for a developer on
        one platform to avoid breaking some other platform when a change is

        When a specific change to the software is proposed for discussion or
        voting on the mailing list, it should be presented in the form of input
        to the patch command. When sent to the mailing list, the message
        should contain a Subject beginning with <code>[PATCH]</code> and a
        distinctive one-line summary corresponding to the action item for that
        patch. Afterwards, the patch summary in the STATUS file should be
        updated to point to the Message-ID of that message.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The patch should be created by using the <CODE>diff -u</CODE>
        command from the original software file(s) to the modified software
        file(s).
      </p>
                                <p class="example">Example</p>
                                <pre>diff -u http_main.c.orig http_main.c &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</pre>
                                <p>or</p>
                                <pre>cvs diff -u http_main.c &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</pre>
                                <p>
        All patches necessary to address an action item should be concatenated
        within a single patch message. If later modification of the patch
        proves necessary, the entire new patch should be posted and not just
        the difference between two patches. The STATUS file entry should then
        be updated to point to the new patch message.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The completed patchfile should produce no errors or prompts when the
        command,
      </p>
                                <pre>patch -s &lt; patchfile</pre>
                                <p>is issued in the target repository.</p>
