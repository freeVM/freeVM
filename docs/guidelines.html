This document defines the guidelines for the
<a href="http://harmony.apache.org/">Apache Harmony Project</a>.
It includes definitions of how conflict is resolved by voting,
who is able to vote, and the procedures to follow for proposing and 
making changes to the Apache products.
</p>
                                <p>
The objective here is to avoid unnecessary conflict over changes and
continue to produce a quality system in a timely manner.  Not all conflict
can be avoided, but at least we can agree on the procedures for conflict
to be resolved.

  <dt><strong>Apache Harmony Project Management Committee</strong></dt>
  <dd>The group of volunteers who are responsible for managing the Apache
      Harmony Project.  This includes deciding what is distributed 
      as products of the Project, maintaining the 
      Project's shared resources, speaking on behalf of the Project, 
      resolving license disputes regarding Apache products, nominating
      new PMC members or committers, and establishing these guidelines.

      <p>Membership in the Apache PMC is by invitation only and must
      be approved by consensus of the active Apache PMC members.
      A PMC member is considered inactive by their own declaration or by 
      not contributing in any form to the project for over six months.  
      An inactive member can become active again by reversing whichever
      condition made them inactive (<em>i.e.</em>, by reversing their 
      earlier declaration or by once again contributing toward the 
      project's work).  Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of 
      all the active PMC members other than the member in question.</p>

      <p>
      Our goal is that every committer willing and interested in the day-to-day
      oversight and management of the project will be invited at the right time
      to join the PMC.  Our goal is 100% of the committers on the PMC.
      </p>
     
     <p>
     <b>Please Note : </b>  While in incubation, the PPMC of the incubating
       Harmony project will play the role of the official PMC.
     </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Apache Harmony Committers</strong></dt>
  <dd>The group of volunteers who are responsible for the technical
      aspects of the Apache Harmony Project.  This group has
      write access to the appropriate source repositories and these
      volunteers may cast binding votes on any technical discussion.

      <p>Membership as a Committer is by invitation only and must
      be approved by consensus of the active Apache PMC members.
      A Committer is considered inactive by their own declaration or by 
      not contributing in any form to the project for over six months.  
      An inactive member can become active again by reversing whichever
      condition made them inactive (<em>i.e.</em>, by reversing their 
      earlier declaration or by once again contributing toward the 
      project's work).  Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of 
      all the active PMC members (except the member in question if they
      are a PMC member).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Apache Harmony Developers</strong></dt>
  <dd>All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation,
      or resources to the Apache Harmony Project.  A developer that makes sustained,
      welcome contributions to the project for over six months is usually
      invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of such
      invitations depends on many factors.</dd>

  <dt><strong>dev@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Apache developers' primary mailing list for discussion of issues
      and changes related to the project (<em>dev@harmony.apache.org</em>).
      Subscription to the list is open, but only subscribers
      can post directly to the list.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>private@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Apache Harmony PMC's private mailing list for discussion of issues
      that are inappropriate for public discussion, such as legal, personal,
      or security issues prior to a published fix.  Subscription to the list
      is only open to Apache Harmony PMC  members.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>commits@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>All of the Apache projects are maintained in shared information
      repositories using SVN.
      Only some of the Apache developers (the committers) have
      write access to these repositories; everyone has read access via
      <a href="anoncvs">anonymous SVN</a>. 
  </dd>

      <a name="STATUS">STATUS</a>
    </h1>
                        <p>Each of the Apache Harmony's active source code repositories contain a 
file called "STATUS" which is used to keep track of the agenda and plans 
for work within that repository.  The STATUS file includes information 
about release plans, a summary of code changes committed since the last 
release, a list of proposed changes that are under discussion, brief 
notes about items that individual developers are working on or want 
discussion about, and anything else that might be useful to help the 
group track progress.  The active STATUS files are automatically posted 
to the mailing list each week.</p>
                                <p>Many issues will be encountered by the project, each resulting in 
zero or more proposed action items.  Issues should be raised on the
mailing list as soon as they are identified.  Action items 
<strong>must</strong> be raised on the mailing list and added to the 
relevant STATUS file.  All action items may be voted on, but not all 
of them will require a formal vote.</p>
                <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
                                                <h1>
      <a name="Voting">Voting</a>
    </h1>
                        <p>Any of the Apache Developers may vote on any issue or action item.
However, the only binding votes are those cast by active members of the
Apache Harmony PMC; if the vote is about a change to source code or 
documentation, the primary author of what is being changed may also 
cast a binding vote on that issue.  All other votes are non-binding.
All developers are encouraged to participate in decisions, but the 
decision itself is made by those who have been long-time contributors 
to the project.  In other words, the Apache Harmony Project is a 
minimum-threshold meritocracy.</p>
                                <p>The act of voting carries certain obligations -- voting members are 
not only stating their opinion, they are agreeing to help do the work of 
the Apache Harmony Project.  Since we are all volunteers, members often become 
inactive for periods of time in order to take care of their "real jobs" 
or devote more time to other projects. It is therefore unlikely that the 
entire group membership will vote on every issue.  To account for this, 
all voting decisions are based on a minimum quorum.</p>
                                <p>Each vote can be made in one of three flavors:</p>
                                <dl>
  <dt><strong>+1</strong></dt>
  <dd>Yes, agree, or the action should be performed.  On some issues, this
      vote is only binding if the voter has tested the action on
      their own system(s).
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>0</strong></dt>
  <dd>Abstain, no opinion, or I am happy to let the other group members
      decide this issue.  An abstention may have detrimental effects if
      too many people abstain.
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>-1</strong></dt>
  <dd>No. On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a
      <strong>veto</strong>.  All vetos must include an explanation of
      why the veto is appropriate.  A veto with no explanation is void.
      No veto can be overruled. If you disagree with the veto, you
      should lobby the person who cast the veto. Voters intending to veto
      an action item should make their opinions known to the group immediately,
      so that the problem can be remedied as early as possible.
  </dd>
</dl>
                                <p>An action item requiring <em>consensus approval</em> must receive
at least <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and <strong>no vetos</strong>.
An action item requiring <em>majority approval</em> must receive
at least <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and more <strong>+1</strong>
votes than <strong>-1</strong> votes (<em>i.e.</em>, a majority with a minimum
quorum of three positive votes).  All other action items are considered
to have <em>lazy approval</em> until someone votes <strong>-1</strong>,
after which point they are decided by either consensus or a majority vote,
depending upon the type of action item.</p>
                                <p>Votes are tallied within the STATUS file, adjacent to the action
item under vote. All votes must be sent to the mailing list.</p>

      <a name="Types of Action Items">Types of Action Items</a>
    </h1>
                        <dl>
  <dt><strong>Long Term Plans</strong></dt>
  <dd>Long term plans are simply announcements that group members
      are working on particular issues related to the Apache software.
      These are not voted on,
      but group members who do not agree with a particular plan,
      or think an alternate plan would be better, are obligated to
      inform the group of their feelings.  In general, it is always
      better to hear about alternate plans <strong>prior</strong> to
      spending time on less adequate solutions.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Short Term Plans</strong></dt>
  <dd>Short term plans are announcements that a developer is working on
      a particular set of documentation or code files, with the implication
      that other developers should avoid them or try to coordinate their
      changes.  This is a good way to proactively avoid conflict and 
      possible duplication of work.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Release Plan</strong></dt>
  <dd>A release plan is used to keep all the developers aware of when a
      release is desired, who will be the release manager, when the
      repository will be frozen in order to create the release, and 
      assorted other trivia to keep us from tripping over ourselves
      during the final moments.  Lazy majority decides each issue in
      the release plan.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Release Testing</strong></dt>
  <dd>After a new release is built, colloquially termed a tarball, it
      must be tested before being released to the public.  Majority
      approval is required before the tarball can be publically released.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Showstoppers</strong></dt>
  <dd>Showstoppers are issues that require a fix be in place
      before the next public release.  They are listed in the STATUS file
      in order to focus special attention on the problem.  An issue becomes
      a showstopper when it is listed as such in STATUS and remains
      so by lazy consensus.
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Product Changes</strong></dt>
  <dd>Changes to the Apache products, including code and documentation,
      will appear as action items under several categories corresponding
      to the change status:
      <dl>
      <dt><strong>concept/plan</strong></dt>
      <dd>An idea or plan for a change.  These are usually only listed in
          STATUS when the change is substantial, significantly impacts the
          API, or is likely to be controversial.  Votes are being requested
          early so as to uncover conflicts before too much work is done.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>proposed patch</strong></dt>
      <dd>A specific set of changes to the current product in the form
          of <a href="#patch">input to the patch command</a> (a diff output).
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>committed change</strong></dt>
      <dd>A one-line summary of a change that has been committed to the
          repository since the last public release.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>All product changes to the currently active repository are subject
      to lazy consensus.  All product changes to a prior-branch (old version)
      repository require consensus before the change is committed.</p>

  With a commit-then-review process, we trust that the developer doing the
  commit has a high degree of confidence in the change. Doubtful changes,
  new features, and large-scale overhauls need to be discussed before
  being committed to a repository. Any major change
  must receive consensus approval on the mailing list before being committed.
  For detailed instructions on reporting, resolving and closing issues, refer to
  <a href="issue_resolution_guideline.html">
    Good Issue Resolution Guideline</a>. 
</p>
                                <p>Each developer is responsible for notifying the mailing list and 
adding an action item to STATUS when they have an idea for a new feature 
or major change to propose for the product.  The distributed nature of the
Apache project requires an advance notice of 48 hours in order to properly
review a major change -- consensus approval of either the concept or a
specific patch is required before the change can be committed.  Note that
a committer might veto the concept (with an adequate explanation), but later
rescind that veto if a specific patch satisfies their objections.
No advance notice is required to commit singular bug fixes.</p>
                                <p>Related changes should be committed as a group, or very closely 
together.  Half-completed projects should not be committed unless 
doing so is necessary to pass the baton to another developer who has 
agreed to complete the project in short order.  All code changes must 
be successfully compiled on the developer's platform before being 
committed.</p>
                                <p>The current source code tree should be capable of complete compilation
at all times.  However, it is sometimes impossible for a developer on
one platform to avoid breaking some other platform when a change is
committed, particularly when completing the change requires access to
a special development tool on that other platform.  If it is anticipated
that a given change will break some other platform, the committer must
indicate that in the commit log.</p>
                                <p>The committer is responsible to follow the Apache Harmony procedure
for any third-party code
or documentation they commit to the repository.  All software committed
to the repository must be covered by the Apache LICENSE or contain a
copyright and license that allows redistribution under the same conditions
as the Apache LICENSE.</p>
                                <p>A committed change must be reversed if it is vetoed by one of the 
voting committers and the veto conditions cannot be immediately satisfied by 
the equivalent of a "bug fix" commit.  The veto must be rescinded before 
the change can be included in any public release.</p>

                        <p>When a specific change to the software is proposed for discussion or
voting on the mailing list, it should be presented in the form of input 
to the patch command.  When sent to the mailing list, the message 
should contain a Subject beginning with <code>[PATCH]</code> and a 
distinctive one-line summary corresponding to the action item for that 
patch.  Afterwards, the patch summary in the STATUS file should be 
updated to point to the Message-ID of that message.</p>
                                <p>The patch should be created by using the <CODE>diff -u</CODE> 
command from the original software file(s) to the modified software 
file(s).  E.g.,</p>
                                <pre>    diff -u http_main.c.orig http_main.c &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</pre>
                                <p>or</p>
                                <pre>    cvs diff -u http_main.c &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</pre>
                                <p>All patches necessary to address an action item should be concatenated
within a single patch message.  If later modification of the patch
proves necessary, the entire new patch should be posted and not just
the difference between two patches.  The STATUS file entry should then
be updated to point to the new patch message.</p>
                                <p>The completed patchfile should produce no errors or prompts when the
command,</p>
                                <pre>    patch -s &lt; patchfile</pre>
                                <p>is issued in the target repository.</p>
