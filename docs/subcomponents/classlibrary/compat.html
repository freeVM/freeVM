                to producing a set of class library code that not only Java compliant but is also

                This page describes the class library code guidelines for ensuring that compatibility.

                    effort is producing a set of class library code that is compatible with

                        the Java SE 5.0 API

                                <p>
                    At times (discussed below) it is necessary to augment the specification based on the
                    behavior of the reference implementation (RI) of the Java SE 5.0 specification. In
                    such cases we use <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">
                        the latest official release of the Java SE 5.0 RI</a>.

                    We are aware that there are other compliant implementations of Java 5.0 available
                    but there is only one reference implementation of the Java specification.

                        <p>
                    The following general guidelines apply when developing class library code for Apache
                    Harmony:
                </p>
                                <dl>
                    <dt>Comply with the Java Specification</dt>
                    <dd>
                        In the first instance we follow the description of each part of the class
                        library given in the <a href="#referenceImpl">Java specification</a>. To
                        the large part, this adequately describes the behavior of the class library
                        implementation including methods, exceptions, and serialization. However,
                        where the specification is silent on a particular issue facing the implementor,
                        or the described behavior is clearly illogical, then we follow the behavior
                        of the reference implementation.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Follow the Reference Implementation</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The Reference Implementation (RI) is used to resolve issues that are not
                        adequately addressed in the specification. In such cases we use the RI as a
                        guide to the compliant and expected behavior; however, developers <em>must</em>
                        ensure that the behaviour of the RI is determined soley through exercising the
                        public Java APIs -- specifically we avoid any notion of reverse engineering or
                        exposition of the RI's implementation by exercising non-API types and methods.
                        <br />
                        There are a few occasions where both the specification is quiet on a given
                        issue, and the RI exhibits behaviour that we would consider illogical. In such
                        cases we discuss the issue on <a href="../../mailing.html">
                            the Harmony developers' mailing list</a>, and code the class libraries to
                        do what the development community
                        conclude is "the logical thing".
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <b>Do "the Logical Thing"</b>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The final decision about how a piece of code should behave, on those rare occasions
                        where the specification and RI do not provide a satisfactory answer, is reached
                        by concensus on the Harmony developers' mailing list. Each issue is debated based
                        on it's individual circumstances, but the developers are aware that breaking popular
                        applications is invariably not "the logical thing" to do.
                        <br />
                        Once a decision has been made it is documented in the code comments and an issue
                        raised in <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY">
                            the Harmony JIRA issue tracking system</a> to record the conclusion. It should be
                        noted that very few issues need to be resolved this way.

                </dl>

                        <p>
                    There are a number of methods in the Java specification that describe the conditions under
                    which exceptions are thrown. However, in most cases the specification does not describe all possible
                    exceptions that may be thrown, the order of exception throwing (i.e. where there are multiple
                    conditions that would result in an exception), and so on.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    The Harmony class libary code aims to be fully compatible with the Reference Implementation (RI)
                    of the Java Specification by matching the exception characteristics of each method.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Harmony
                    <b>classlib</b> developers write test cases that deliberately cause exceptions to be thrown
                    so that we can match exception behaviour like-for-like. Harmony class library code throws exceptions
                    of the same runtime class (or a subtype of that runtime class) as the RI, other than
                    in cases where the RI throws non-public types whereupon Harmony will throw an exception with the same public supertype.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Generally, we could refer to the following steps.
                </p>
                                <dl>

                    <dd>
                        We shall follow RI's behavior, that is, throws exactly the same exception or a subclass of the exception.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            But there are some cases that RI throws an implementation specific exception,
                            which is not in the Java Specification, we shall throw an equivalent Harmony specific exception,
                            or its superclass in the Java Specification.

                        <p>
                    The Harmony class library code aims to be serialization compatible with the reference
                    implementation (RI).
                </p>
                                <p>
                    The Java Specification describes the serialized form of many Java types. Where given, <b>classlib</b> will follow
                    the specified serialized form. When the serialized form is NOT given we will ensure that the
                    serialization data is compatible with the RI by ensuring that objects serialized from the RI
                    can be read by Harmony's <b>classlib</b> code, and vice versa.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Serialization tests are part
                    of our regular test suite and typically rely on having the persistent form of serialized objects
                    written from the RI stored alongside our test suite code.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    To indicate that we are serialization-compatible we define an explicit Stream Unique Identifier
                    (SUID) in each of the Harmony <b>classlib</b> serializable types that is equal to the SUID of
                    the corresponding type in the RI.
                </p>
                                <p>
                    Where the RI produces a serialized form that cannot be replicated by Harmony (e.g. the RI serialized
                    form includes types that are not part of the Java specification) then Harmony cannot be
                    serialization compatible with the RI, and will both make a prominent note of such in the relevant
                    type's JavaDoc comment, and raise a JIRA issue that describes the incompatibility.
                </p>
