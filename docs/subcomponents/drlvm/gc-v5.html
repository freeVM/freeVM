<h1> <a
name="about_this_document"></a>1. About This Document</h1>
<h2><a name="purpose"></a>1.1           Purpose</h2>
<p>This document introduces the <em>generational garbage collector</em> (a.k.a GC version
  5, GCv5) component delivered as part of the DRL (Dynamic Runtime Layer) initiative.
  This document focuses on the specifics of the current implementation showing the
  garbage collector role inside the DRL virtual machine, and the internal organization
  of the garbage collection subsystem. This document uses the <a
href="../../../../H-3886/docs/documentation/conventions.html">unified conventions</a> for
  the DRL documentation kit.</p>
<h2> <a id="Intended_Audience" name="Intended_Audience"></a>1.2 Intended Audience </h2>
<p> The target audience for the document includes
  a wide community of engineers interested in further work with garbage collecting
  technology to contribute to its development. The document assumes that readers
  are familiar with DRLVM architecture basics, garbage collection methodologies and
structures.</p>
<h2> <a id="Documentation_Conventions"
         name="Documentation_Conventions"></a>1.3 Documentation Conventions </h2>
<p> This document uses the <a href="../../documentation/conventions.html"> unified
    conventions</a> for the DRL documentation kit. </p>
<h2><a name="terminology" id="terminology"></a>1.4           Terminology</h2>
<p>The document uses a number of key terms related to memory management, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heap</b> - the memory where
  Java objects are allocated and stay.</li>
<li><b>Memory manager</b> - a low-level
  component in the runtime system responsible for managing the memory used by the
  system. <br>
  The memory manager interacts with the underlying platform, especially the native
  memory, and provides a unified interface to the system components for memory usage. </li>
<li><b>Garbage collector </b> -
  a higher-level a component in the runtime system responsible for automatic memory
  management. <br>
  The garbage collector performs new object allocation and dead object reclamation,
  and may also improve object access locality by re-arranging the live object layout
  in the heap. This role is increasingly important along with the evolution of modern
  platforms. </li>
<li><b>Space</b> - a part of the
  heap managed separately. </li>
<li><b>Collector</b> - the thread
  that conducts garbage collection on the heap. <br>
  A parallel GC can have multiple collectors running collaboratively.</li>
<li><b>Mutator</b> - the thread
  that executes on behalf of the user application, such as a Java* thread. <br>
  A VM internal thread, such as finalizing thread, can also be treated as a mutator,
  because it executes Java object finalizers.</li>
<li><b>Minor collection</b> - the
  collection working with only a part of the heap, usually containing the space for
  the newly allocated objects.</li>
<li><b>Major collection</b> - the
  collection that covers the whole heap.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a
name="Overview"></a>2.   Overview</h1>
<p>Usually, a runtime system has a memory manager for all memory-related functionality,
  and the memory manager can host multiple garbage collectors on top of it. The current
  Harmony DRL virtual machine has no separate memory manager module (under design),
  and two functional garbage collector modules. GCv5 is current Harmony default GC.
  This document describes GCv5 only.</p>
<h2><a
name="Background"></a>2.1           Background:
    GC History</h2>
<p>So far, Harmony DRLVM has delivered three independent stop-the-world garbage collectors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GCv4</b> is a sequential non-generational mark-compaction collector based
    on the LISP2 compactor algorithm [<a href="#abuaiadh">3</a>][<a href="#knut">4</a>]. This is a legacy collector and no longer
    maintained, though the code base is still kept in Harmony source tree for reference.</li>
  <li><b>GCv4.1</b> (a.k.a gc_cc) is a sequential non-generational copying collector
    with a compaction fall-back, based on the threaded reference algorithm [<a href="#_jonkers">1</a>][<a href="#morris">2</a>]. </li>
  <li><b>GCv5</b> is a fully parallel collector that can work in generational and
    non-generational modes. GCv5 achieves good scalability on shared-memory machines
    that have multiple processors or multiple cores. </li>
</ul>
<p> Two more completely new collectors are under development. Working parts of their
code are already in Apache Harmony code base. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> GCv6 </strong> improves the collection performance over GCv5 for many
    workloads. It employs a semi-space algorithm for minor collection, and a compact
    algorithm as fallback or major collection. <strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong> Tick </strong> is a concurrent collector kit implementing several
    concurrent GC algorithms , including mostly-concurrent GC, DLG-based on-the-fly
    GC, and sliding-view on-the-fly GC.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><a
name="key_features"></a>2.2           Key
    Features</h2>
<p>GCv5 possesses the following key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pluggability</b>: The collector is fully pluggable into DRLVM architecture
    and interacts with the VM via the standardized <a
 href="http://harmony.apache.org/subcomponents/drlvm/doxygen/vmcore/html/vm__gc_8h.html">VM-GC
    interface</a>. You can create and plug in another collector instead of this garbage
    collector by following instructions of the <a
 href="gc-howto.html">How To Write
    GC</a> document.</li>
  <li><b>Modularity: </b></li>
  <ul >
    <li><b>Threading</b>: GCv5 has an abstraction on threads: the <b>Allocator</b> superclass
      with collectors and mutators as subclasses. They both allocate memory: the
      mutator - for new objects, and the collector - for object copying. At the same
      time, GCv5 does not use mutator�s context for collection, that is, mutators
      and collectors are independent thread entities. This design separates the contexts
      of allocation and collection, which simplifies transitions between allocation
      and collection.</li>
    <li><b>Space management</b>: GCv5 has an abstraction on space: each space related
      to a collection algorithm. For example, Fspace is the space managed with the
      copying algorithm. In this way, a GC is only a combination of multiple spaces,
      or it is a collaborator of multiple collection algorithms over the heap. This
      design separates the collection algorithm from GC construction, which simplifies
      the construction of a new GC based on the existing collection algorithms.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Flexibility</b>: GCv5 can adjust dynamically at run time depending on workload
    behavior, see <a href="#Adaptation_Techniques">Adaptation Techniques</a>. Examples
    of such runtime adjustment are:</li>
  <ul >
    <li>Triggering a minor or a major collection for best performance</li>
    <li>Adjusting the size of spaces depending on the characteristics of allocated
      objects</li>
    <li>Dynamically switching between generational and non-generational collections</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Scalability</b>: GCv5 is a fully parallel GC with major garbage collection
    phases parallelized. GCv5 uses new load-balance mechanisms and parallel collection
    techniques. This garbage collector can achieve very good scalability on shared
    memory platforms that have no more than 8 processors or cores. </li>
  <li><b>Platform support</b>: GCv5 is primarily as a 32-bit component with 64-bit
    support enabled via the compressed reference technique, where a 64-bit pointer
    can be represented in 32 bits. See <a
 href="#_Object_references">Object references</a> for more details. The collector
    runs on Windows and on Linux.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a
name="architecture"></a>3.   Architecture</h1>
<h2><a
name="heap_partitioning"></a>3.1 Heap Partitioning</h2>
<p>In GCv5, all spaces are inherited from a common <code>Space</code> class. <i>Blocked space</i> is
  a space type <code>Blocked_Space</code> where the space is arranged in fixed-size blocks. Another
  derived structure of Space is <code>Lspace</code>, which consists of alternate-sized blocks.
  Currently, the space is continuous and the blocked space assumes the blocks are
  contiguous. In future, this assumption may be removed. </p>
<p>Division of the heap into spaces relies on the size of allocated objects: <i>normal
    objects</i> are of size equal to or smaller than a threshold (called the large
    object size threshold), and <i>large objects</i> are of size greater than the
    threshold. Based on that, the default GCv5 configuration partitions the heap
    space into three basic parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nursery object space (NOS) is used for normal object allocation. </li>
  <li>Mature object space (MOS) is used for allocation of NOS survivor objects: in
    a minor collection, live objects in NOS are copied to MOS free area.</li>
  <li>Large object space (LOS) used for large object allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The
boundaries between the spaces are automatically adjustable by GC according to the
space, utilizations; see Figure 1.

<h2><a name="Adaptation_Techniques"></a>3.2           Run-time
  Adaptations</h2>
<p>Adaptation of the garbage collection process at run time is essential for good
  GC performance. GCv5 supports the following runtime automatic adaptations:</p>

name="switch_major_minor"></a>3.2.1        Switch between major
  and minor collections modes</h3>
<p>The minor collection is significantly faster than the major collection, but the
  major collection frees more space. GCv5 switches between the two kinds of collections
  with a throughput-driven heuristic algorithm. Roughly speaking, a major collection
  will be triggered when MOS is approximately half-filled.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="notetext">Users can specify the major collection type in command line, so that
  all collections are full-heap collections.</p>
<h3><a
name="switch_gen_nongen"></a>3.2.2        Switch between
  generational and non-generational modes</h3>
<p>In the non-generational mode, a minor collection traces the entire heap from the
  root set for live-object marking, and in the generational mode, only NOS is traced
  from both remember set and root set. In the latter case, the GC does not trace
  the whole heap, but can retain lots of floating garbage. GCv5 can dynamically switch
  between generational and non-generational modes so as to leverage both advantages.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="notetext">This adaptation is turned off by default because the performance
  depends on the workload's behavior. </p>
<h3><a
name="adjust_space_size"></a>3.2.3        Dynamically
    adjust space size for best heap utilization</h3>
<p>Based on the survive ratios and allocation speeds of the spaces, GCv5 reserves
  only adequate MOS free space for the NOS minor collection, and tries to get MOS
  and LOS equally full when a major collection happens. In other words, GC adjusts
  <code>nos_boundary</code> after each collection, and <code>los_boundary</code> after a major collection,
  if necessary.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="notetext">If the MOS reserve space is not enough to hold NOS-survived objects,
  the fall-back compaction happens.</p>
<h2><a
name="_Object_references"></a>3.3           Object
    References </h2>
<p>The JVM specification does not govern reference representation and leaves this
  to the VM implementation. You can have 32-bit or 64-bit or hybrid reference representations
  considering the cost-efficiency in space and time. For generic information on object
  references, including compressed references for 64-bit platform support, please
  refer to the developer's guide.</p>
<p>GCv5 defines the REF type for an object reference, and does not take into account
  the layout or physical meaning of a <code>REF</code> value. When the collector accesses a reference,
  it always calls <code>ref_to_obj_ptr()</code> to convert the <code>REF</code> value to a real address pointer.
  Conversely, the collector needs to <code>call obj_ptr_to_ref()</code> to encode an address into
  a reference. The encoding rule is set by the implementation of this function depending
  on the platform: on a 32-bit platform, this function can return the same value
  untouched, and on a 64-bit platform, it can use the �compressed reference� technique
  to encode/decode <code>REF</code> into an object pointer. </p>
<p>A &quot;<em>compressed reference</em>&quot; is a form of object reference representation,
  where the runtime environment uses a 32-bit value for object reference representation.
  The real address is the sum of the 32-bit value and a heap base address value,
  and the compressed value of this heap base address is zero. To distinguish this
  zero value from the NULL reference, the GC avoids having the zero value by setting
  the heap base address several bytes lower than the real heap start address. </p>
<p>All reference fields are encoded in the 32-bit compressed mode, and we also use
  32-bit compressed mode to encode the vtable field in the object header. Because
  the <code>obj_info</code> field is kept 32-bit on both platforms, the total object header overhead
  remains two 32-bit words (or one 64-bit word). </p>
<h2><a

<h1><a
name="Processes"></a>4.   Processes</h1>
<h2><a
name="memory_allocation"></a>4.1           Memory
    allocation</h2>
<p>GCv5 has 2 types of allocation: mutator allocation for the needs of mutator threads,
  and collector allocation only for trace-forward algorithm during collection.</p>
<h3><a
name="mutator_allocation"></a>4.1.1   Mutator allocation</h3>
<p>According to the requested size, memory is allocated in different spaces. If the
  object is larger than the large object size threshold, it is allocated in LOS;
  otherwise, it is called a normal size object and is allocated in NOS.</p>
<p>For higher parallelism and better locality, each mutator is associated with a
  local block of space. If the requested object is a normal size object, it is allocated
  in this local block directly. When spaces in the local block runs out, the mutator
  gets the next free block in NOS.</p>
<h3><a
name="collector_allocation"></a>4.1.2   Collector allocation</h3>
<p>During minor collections, live objects in NOS are copied to MOS. Allocation in
  MOS uses the same interface as allocation in NOS, except that the large object
  threshold is not checked.</p>
<h2><a
name="RSE"></a>4.2           Root
    set enumeration</h2>
<p>In tracing garbage collection, a <i>root</i> is a reference to an object that
  is a priori reachable. Roots basically comprise the references in the state of
  the mutator. Typical roots are global variables, other static data, and the control
  stack. The <i>root set</i> is the collection of roots when GC is invoked. The root
  set is used as the starting point in determining all reachable data. The enumeration
  process is to gather all roots into the root set.</p>
<p>In DRLVM, the enumeration process is a part of VM core rather than of a GC, and
  is identical for all collectors.</p>
<p>Before root set enumeration, the mutator, which invokes GC, tries to suspend all
  mutators one by one expect itself. Only when a mutator is suspended, its state
  is invariable and thus ready for root set enumeration and subsequent garbage collection.
  After all mutators are suspended, the mutator, which invokes GC, finds all roots
  of each mutator and all global variables to compose the root set.</p>
<h2><a
name="GC"></a>4.3           Garbage
    collection</h2>
<p><a
name="_Generational/non_generational"></a>GCv5 has two types of garbage collections: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Minor collection</i> collects only NOS, which holds all newly allocated
    normal-size objects in the last GC cycle. In this collection, all live objects
    in NOS are traced and forwarded into MOS. After a minor collection, NOS becomes
    a continuous free area ready for allocation.</li>
  <li><i>Major collection</i> considers MOS and NOS a single virtually continuous
    space and compacts all live objects in this space to the lower end of it. After
    this collection, this space consists of a continuous live data area and a continuous
    free area. The NOS boundary is reset to a new address according to the live ratio
    of objects in NOS, so that both MOS and NOS get reasonable free spaces to maximize
    performance. The major collection also collects LOS with the mark-sweep algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minor collection is expected to produce a better throughput (relation of the
  free memory space to GC time), because it only collects NOS, and objects in NOS
  tend to become unused sooner than those in MOS, which are copied from NOS in minor
  collections. This way, the minor collection takes significantly less time than
  the major collection and is invoked in most GC cases. Only when the throughput
  of the minor collection is equal to that of the major collection, or when MOS has
  run out of free space, a major collection is invoked.</p>
<h3><a
name="minor_collection"></a>4.3.1   Minor collection --- trace-forward algorithm</h3>
<p>Based on whether MOS and LOS are traced, the minor collection has two modes, which
  can be specified on the command line or adapted at run time.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Non-Generational mode</dt>
<dd>Collectors trace all objects in the whole heap in the depth-first order.
<br/>When tracing an object for the first time, the collector copies that object into
  MOS and stores the forwarding pointer (the new address in MOS) in the object header
  of the original object. When the GC finds that an object is forwarded, the reference
  pointing to that object is updated by collectors.
<br/>After all objects in NOS are copied into MOS, the collection is over and NOS is
  ready for the following mutator allocation.</dd>
<dt>Generational mode </dt>
<dd>Rather than tracing all objects in the heap, collectors trace only objects in
  NOS. Objects in MOS and LOS are ignored and considered live objects. In this case,
  the GC must store the references from non-NOS to NOS, the set of which is called
  the remember set (the rem set). The rem set is considered a part of the root set
  when tracing live objects.
<br/>Except for the above, the generational trace-forward collection is identical in
  tracing and copying.</dd>
<dt>Selecting generational mode or non-generational mode</dt>
<dd>The generational mode is preferred over the non-generational mode if: 
<ul>
	<li>The application behavior matches the generational hypothesis</li>
	<li>The overhead for the non-generational mode mark-scan is too high</li>
 </ul>	<p>The hybrid mode results in better performance than either generational or non-generational
  mode. The real performance depends on workloads.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>
<h3><a
name="major_collection"></a>4.3.2   Major collection --- Compaction algorithms</h3>
<p>GCv5 uses two compaction algorithms in the major collection: the parallel LISP2-based
  sliding compactor and the two-pass parallel move-compactor.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Parallel LISP2-based sliding compactor</dt>
<dd>
<p>This compactor is composed of three
    main phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Target-address computing</i></a>:
    compute target addresses for all live objects in the heap and, usually, install
    a forwarding pointer in the object header for each live object. The target address
    of a live object is its new location after the compaction process.</li>
  <li><i>Reference re-pointing</i>: traverse
      the heap and re-point all object references in the heap to the target addresses
      of the reference objects.</li>
  <li><i>Object moving</i>: move the live
      objects in order from one end of the heap through the other. When an object
    is copied to its new location, the original data in this location has been copied
      already, so that no data loss occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the compaction process, each space block can act as the source from which
  data is copied, and as the destination block where live data is copied to. The
  key idea is that a list of source blocks is created for each destination block
  during phase 1, and then each thread picks a source block from the list of blocks
  for this destination block to copy live data from the source to the destination. </p>
<p>All the phases can be executed by multiple threads in parallel, as long as there
  is a barrier between two phases.</p>
<p>It is proved that when an area in the destination block is acting as the destination
  area, live objects in it must have been copied in phase 3. This guarantees that
  the data unread by one thread cannot be overwritten by another thread.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how collector threads compact live objects from source
  blocks into destination blocks in phase 3.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure 2: Collector threads compacting live objects </strong></p>
  <p><img src="images/lisp2.gif"></p>
</dd>
<dt>2-pass parallel-move compactor</dt>
<dd>
<p>The parallel-move compactor has fewer passes than the parallel sliding compactor.
  Its key idea is based on the parallel compaction algorithm defined at [<a href="#abuaiadh">3</a>], but
  the parallelization scheme in GCv5 is different, and free spaces between live objects
  in a sector are not compacted.</p>
<p>This compactor is composed of two main phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Object moving</i>: move live data
    from the source to the destination. Each collector gets a source block and a destination
    block, as with the parallel sliding compactor. The source block is partitioned
    into fixed-size sectors (currently, 256 bytes). In each sector, the area of unmarked
    objects at the head and the end of this sector is considered free and will be squeezed
    out. The area in the middle, with or without free areas, is considered to contain
    live data and is moved to the destination block. During moving, collectors record
    the offset of the new starting address of that live area into the sector offset
    table in the block header.</li>
  <li><i>Reference re-pointing</i>: use
      the sector offset in the block header to get the new address of each live object,
      and fix re-pointed references.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following figure shows how the move-compactor works.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Move Compactor</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/move_compactor.gif"></p>
</dd>  </dl>
<p>Currently, GCv5 uses parallel-move compactor and parallel sliding compactor for
  respective collection scenarios.</p>

<h3><a
name="Fallback"></a>4.3.3   Fallback</h3>
<p>Before mutators run at the beginning of each GC cycle, a part of the continuous
  free area in MOS and NOS is reserved for the free MOS area, and the rest is NOS.
  Because the survive ratio of NOS in the next minor collection is unpredictable,
  the free MOS area might be smaller than needed. In this case, MOS cannot accommodate
  all live objects in NOS in the next minor collection, and the GC stops the minor
  collection and launches a major collection, which is called <i>fallback</i> in
  GCv5.</p>
<p>For better modularity of GCv5, the fallback mechanism could be straightforward:
  when collectors find that a fallback is needed, they give up the minor collection
  and return to the main GC process. The GC launches a major collection and re-activates
  the collectors. However, this kind of major collection is a little different from
  the usual major collection, because some objects in NOS are copied into MOS and
  some references pointing to them are not updated in the minor collection. The solution
  is to update those stale references in the marking phase of the major collection.
  Except for this, other collection phases are identical to the normal major collection.</p>
<h2><a
name="parallel_load_balance"></a>4.4           Parallel
    Load Balance: pool sharing</h2>
<p>GCv5 uses the pool-sharing algorithm to achieve parallel load balance for marking
  and forwarding.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: Pool Sharing</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/pool_sharing.gif"> </p>
<p>As the above figure shows, the task pool serves for the shared pool of task blocks.
  Each task block is an array of references. Getting a task block from the pool or
  putting it there is a synchronized operation. And one reference stands for one
  task. </p>
<p>While marking, a collector grabs a task block from the pool and takes references
  one by one from the task block for tracing in the depth-first order. Child nodes
  in the tracing tree are put to a local mark stack. When the mark stack is full,
  the collector puts the full mark stack into the task pool as a task block, and
  gets another empty stack to hold the child nodes. If the local stack is empty,
  the collector takes another task from the task block. If all references in the
  task block are traced, collector grabs another task block from the task pool to
  trace. When the task pool is empty, tracing is done.</p>
<h2><a
name="finalizer_subsystem_support"></a>4.5           Finalizer
    subsystem support</h2>
<h3><a
name="finalizer_subsystem"></a>4.5.1 Finalizer Subsystem</h3>
<p>For a definition of the finalization system, please see the developer's guide.
  The GCv5 finalizer subsystem includes support for weak references. Because the
  finalizer and the weak reference are similar and closely related, they can be related
  to as the finref subsystem interchangeably with the finalizer subsystem. </p>
<h3><a name="fin_process"></a>4.5.2 Finalization Process</h3>
<p> The finalization process includes the following major activities: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Recognize all the objects that have the finalizer</b>. This is done in the
    mutator's context at the allocation time and it increases the allocation path
    a bit. </li>
  <li><b>Identify the finalizable objects</b>. Once the GC marking phase is finished
    and all live objects are marked, the collector goes through the queue of objects
    with finalizers and checks whether any objects are unreachable. Those unreachable
    objects in the queue are finalizable objects, and passed to VM for finalization.
    Before they are handed over to VM, the collector traces those objects to resurrect
    all the recursively referenced objects from them. This is conducted in the collector's
    context during garbage collection, and is specific for the GC implementation. </li>
  <li><b>Finalize the finalizable objects</b>. VM has a couple of finalizer threads
    sleeping and waiting for new finalization tasks. These finalizer threads are
    native threads associated with Java thread objects, because they act as Java
    threads when executing finalizers. When GC passes new finalizable objects to
    VM, the finalizing threads wake up and start invoking the <code>finalize()</code> method of
    those objects. This is conducted in the finalizer thread context, and is the
    same for all GCs. </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="fin_load_balance"></a>4.5.3 Finalization load balance</h3>
<p>If a mutator keeps producing objects with finalizer, and the finalizers are not
  able to be executed on time, the dead objects waiting for being finalized will
  consume the heap space, and an out-of-memory exception occurs. Harmony produces
  2 solutions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create more finalizing threads to
      compete with the mutators for processor resources, and hopefully executing
    more finalizers than generated by the mutators.</li>
  <li>Block the guilty mutators until the
      queue of finalizable objects are shortened by finalizing threads.</li>
</ol>
<p>GCv4.1 adopts the first solution, and GCv5 adopts the second solution.</p>
