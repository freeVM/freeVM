    </h1>
    <p>
        Java6 introduces a new way for verifying byte code comparing to Java5. Now class files contain stackmaptable
        attribute which was designed to help byte code verifier. Verification of class files containing stackmaptable
        (Java6-verification) is much simpler comparing to original verification of classes not containing this attribute 
        (we will refer to it as "Java5-verification"). This attribute is normally inserted by Java Compiler (javac). 
    </p>
    <p>
        But if some byte code instrumentor makes modification of the original code then stackmaptable inserted by 
        javac becomes invalid. Thus instrumentor should be able to fix stackmaptable and thus there should be a tool 
        that is able to calculate a valid stackmaptable attribute.
    </p>
    <h1>
        <a id="Obstacle" name="Obstacle"></a>Obstacle
    </h1>
    <p>
        Briefly, stackmaptable
        attribute contains information about types that come to each start of liner block (to each branch target). 
        If there are several types coming to some point then stackmaptable for this point contains a type to which all the 
        coming types are assignable to. In particular if class A, B, and C may come to some point then stackmaptable 
        contains their common super class.
    </p>
    <p>
        An obstacle here is that at compile time javac has access
        to all the classes referenced in the class being compiled, while dynamic instrumentors might not have access to some 
        of the referenced classes, thus it's hard to guess which class is a common super class of A, B, and C from the example 
        above. If we knew what specifically is modified by instrumentor and how, we could modify original stackmaptable of the 
        class, but we would like to keep flexibility of instrumentor and not limit its modifications over the code with 
        unnecessary constraints.
    </p>
    <h1>
        <a id="Assumption" name="Assumption"></a>Assumption
    </h1>
    <p>
        We assume that either original class file contained valid byte code or if it does not then it's OK for instrumented 
        class file to contain invalid stackmaptable (so that it will be rejected by the VM later). Thus we will use data from the
        original uninstrumented class file to calculate a new stackmaptable attribute. 
    </p>

    <h1>
        <a id="Idea" name="Idea"></a>High level Idea of the underlying algorithm
    </h1>
    <p>
        To compute stackmaptable attribute verifier uses two types of information: either it needs access to all the classes 
        referenced in the current class (this mode is like how javac calculates stackmaps) or it needs the original class 
        (if the current class was obtained from some original valid class by instrumentation). In the latter case it calculates 
        new stackmap basing on the data extracted from the original class file. There are no different modes: the verifier is 
        always operates in a "mixed" mode: it uses both data extracted from the original class file (when it exists) and try to 
        access referenced classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main function that computes stackmap for the given method is
    </p>
    <pre>
vf_Result
vf_recompute_stackmaptable( method_handler method, uint8 **attrBytes, char **error, void *trustedPairs )
    </pre>
    <p>
	Where trustedParis (which might be 0) contains list of knowingly assignable pairs. If stackmap is recomputed in an 
        instrumentor, referenced files are not always can be accessed at the moment of instrumentation (e.g. they could go 
        from some URL location), so the stackmap data from original (uninstrumented) class file is used instead:
    </p>
    <p>
	First the original class is going to 
    </p>
    <pre>
vf_verify6_class
    </pre>
    <p>
	function, that makes first step of verification: it verifies integrity of the code and checks assignability of the 
	classes available at the moment of first verification step. It creates a list of pairs that are not loaded and need to 
	be checked later. In a normal execution there is a second verification step, where these pairs are forcedly loaded and 
	checked (just before execution of the class).
    </p>
    <p>
	When we recompute stackmaptable for an instrumented class, the second verification step is not performed. Instead we 
	assume that original class file was valid and consider obtained pairs as "trusted" pairs: we assume that they are 
	properly assignable. (There is no problem in this assumption: if it was not the case then our generated stackmaptable 
	would be invalid either and the class would be rejected by VM).
    </p>
    <p>
	Once we are done with the first step Java6 verification of the original class, we go to Java5 verification of the 
	instrumented class. We also perform just the first step of verification (i.e. we don't force loading the classes), 
	pairs of classes to be checked are stored somewhere as well, they are not mixed with our trusted pairs and they are 
	never used later.
    </p>
    <p>
	Once we are done with Java5 verification we don't destroy its temporary data, but start to work with it. So Java5 
	verifier creates its interim stackmaps at the same points where they are necessary according to the spec (Well, it's 
	not quite true. For optimization purposes there are places for some of which interim stackmaps are not created, so I 
	had to implement a flag to switch this optimization off when we are at recompute stackmap mode). 
    </p>
    <p>
	By design of Harmony Java5 verifier, each stackmap contains types that are incoming for the given point as well as types that 
	are expected by the following instructions as well as list of branches where these incoming types go further to. 
	(We propagate incoming types in one direction only: we do add incoming types to all the branch targets, but we don't 
	add expected types to the points which have branches to the current point)
    </p>
    <p>
	Then verifier looks for a "solution": i.e. set of values for each stackmap so that we may prove that 1) each incoming 
	type is assignable to that value 2) the value is assignable to each type expected by the following instructions and 3) 
	the value is assignable to the values (that also belong to the solution) for the branch target stackmaps.
    </p>
    <p>
	Verifier may prove assignability in three ways. Class "A" is provably assignable to class "B" if either 1) we know that 
	"B" is an interface or a super class of A (i.e. A or B is loaded) or 2) list of trusted pairs contain (A, C), where C 
	is provably assignable to B 3) A==B
    </p>
    <p>
	There are exclusions, when verifier does not prove assignability: e.g. if there is just a single incoming type for t
	he given stackmap, then solution contains this type and it is not checked against expected types or branches.
    </p>
    <p>
	To find a solution verifier does NOT apply a brute force search. Instead constraint propagation and backtracking-like 
	algorithms are used:
    <br/>
	First for each node (i.e. for each type in the resulting stackmaptable) it creates a list of types that can potentially 
	be a solution, i.e. all types X for which there exist an incoming type I that provably assignable to X. We'll call this 
	list as "solution candidates".
    <br/>
	Then we reduce the list of solution candidates by removing those candidates X for which there is an expected type E so 
	that X is not provably assignable to E. 
    <br/>
	The state when all solution candidate lists contain exactly one element, will be called "SOLUTION FOUND". The state 
	when there is an empty candidate list, will be "INCONSISTENCY FOUND"
    </p>

    <h2>
	Definition of PROPAGATION
    </h2>
    <p>
	The following procedure will be called "propagation": remove all solution candidates X such that there is a branch B 
	with its own solution candidates B_1, ..., B_N and for each B_i X is not provably assignable to B_i
    </p>

    <h2>
	Definition of SEARCH
    </h2>
    <p>
	A recursive procedure below describes the search for a solution. First we do PROPAGATION. If solution found - global 
	stop, we are done. If inconsistency found - "roll back" to previous recursion level. (If it was the first level, then 
	we are in trouble: the data we had was not enough to build stackmaptable attribute).
    </p>
    <p>
	Then we remember all candidate lists (to return here in case we roll back from the next recursion level), chose 
	a list where there is more than one candidate, select a candidate there, remove all other candidates and apply SEARCH 
	(i.e. launch the next recursion level) with reduced list of candidates. If SEARCH found a solution then it's a global 
	stop. If it found inconsistency then restore remembered state, select another candidate from the list, and launch the 
	next recursion level again. If there are no more candidates and solution is not yet found - roll back to the previous 
	recursion level (if it was the first level - we are in trouble again).
    </p>


    <h2>
	Dealing with dead code
    </h2>
    <p>
	It's not a simple task to calculate stackmaptable attribute for the beginning of dead (unreachable) block of code.
        Despite the code dead, it's verified by Java6 verifier (required by spec) and thus it should satisfy all instructions 
        tat follows. Moreover dead code might be in the scope of a reachable exception handler and thus may affect stackmaptable
        in the reachable parts of the code. So to kill the problem it's easier to modify class file rather than to build 
        stackmaptable (which is even not always possible).
    </p>
    <p>
	First, we avoid the situation when the dead code is the only intersection of two different try blocks (since their 
        handlers may have incompatible types): for each try block that starts or ends in the dead code we reduce scope to 
        eliminate dead code from the try block (when dead code is in the middle then it's OK).
    <br/>
        Next, we change the code in the dead block with NOPs followed by ATHROW.
    <br/>
        Finally, we build stackmaptable for the beginning of the dead block: its stack contains just a single element NULL,
        and (to make it compatible with possible exception handlers) its locals are exactly the same as locals in the 
        stackmaptable for the first alive instruction that follows dead code.
    </p>

    <h2>
	Handling invokevirtual/putfield/getfield instructions
    </h2>
    <p>
	Sometimes verifier has to know whether a field or a method referenced in the class is declared in the super class
        of the current class or not. This is necessary to understand which type the instruction expects. But to answer the 
        question we have to load ether super classes of the current class or a class where referenced member is declared.
        class_is_extending_class method from the class interface is called to figure that out.
    </p>
    <p>
	In our case we can't load additional classes, but recompute stackmap functionality works correct if 
        class_is_extending_class always returns NULL (indicating that referenced class is not a super class of 
        the current one). To make sure that stackmap table is correct verifier chooses the least general 
        (i.e. least close to java.lang.Object) type among several possible for the SOLUTION.
