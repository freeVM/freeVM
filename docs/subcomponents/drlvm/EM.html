         This document describes the internal structure of the execution
         manager component deployed with the virtual machine as part of the DRL
         (Dynamic Runtime Layer) initiative. The description covers the
         internal design of the execution manager and its interaction with
         other DRLVM components. The document is targeted at DRLVM developers
         with special interest in code execution algorithms. The information
         can be helpful for future development of DRL execution management
         techniques and can serve as an example for those implementing an
         execution manager from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
         In this document, you can find implementation-specific details of the
         execution manager. General information on the EM role in overall
         virtual machine design and VM-level requirements are out of scope of
         this document and are covered in the <i>DRLVM Developer's Guide</i>
         [<a href="#DRLDevGuide">3</a>] .

      </h1>
      <p>
         The execution manager is responsible for selecting execution engines
         (a JIT compiler or an interpreter) for method compilation and
         execution at run time. The execution manager (EM) takes input from its
         configuration settings and run-time profile information. The DRL
         execution manager also uses <a href="#PC">profile collectors</a> to
         gather run-time data associated with method code and the just-in-time
         (JIT) compiler that produced the code. The execution manager, profile
         collectors, and execution engines plugged in VM make up the <i>dynamic
         optimization</i> subsystem [<a href="#DynOpt_ref">1</a>], [<a
         href="#SurveyOpt_ref">2</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
         The execution manager instantiates execution engines depending on its
         configuration [<a href="#DRLEmGuide">4</a>] and the current VM mode.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            In the <i>interpreter</i> mode, EM delegates execution of all
            methods to interpreter
         </li>
         <li>
            In the <i>JIT compiler</i> mode, EM does the following: 
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Instantiates and configures profile collectors
               </li>
               <li>
                  Configures execution engines to enable using profile
                  collectors as required
               </li>
               <li>
                  Defines the (re)compilation and dynamic optimization logic
                  using method profiles
               </li>
            </ul>

      </h1>
      <p>
         This section of the document describes the internal architecture of
         the execution manager and its external connections with other
         components of the virtual machine. In brief, EM communicates with the
         VM core and with execution engine(s) at the VM level. Internally, the
         execution manager has a profile collector as its subcomponent, and
         uses internal functional interfaces to communicate with it, as
         described in section <a href="#PC">Profile Collector</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>
         <a id="EM" name="EM"></a>Execution Manager in VM
      </h2>
      <p>
         The VM core component sends requests to EM to execute methods. VM
         passes a method handle and parameters to the execution manager through
         the <code><a href="#EM_VM">EM_VM</a></code> interface. EM selects the
         engine for compiling the method and sends a compilation request to VM
         to compile the method with the selected engine.
      </p>
      <p>
         Instantiating and configuring JIT compilers goes through
         the <code>JIT_EM</code> interface [<a href="#DRLDevGuide">3</a>]. In
         its turn, the execution manager exports the <code>EM_JIT</code>
         interface for accessing method profiles and profile collectors.
         Specifically, the <a href="#EM_JIT">EM_JIT</a> interface consists of
         two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The <i>profile access interface</i> is the generic interface for
            accessing method profiles. Via this interface, a JIT compiler can
            get basic profile properties, such as the profile type.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <i>custom profile collector interface</i> is a custom extension
            of the profile access interface. This interface provides access to
            method profiles of a specific type.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         These interface interactions are shown in Figure 1 and described in
         detail in section <a href="#Interfaces">Public Interfaces</a>.

      <h2>
         <a id="PC" name="PC"></a>Profile Collector
      </h2>
      <p>
         The <i>profile collector</i> (PC) is a subcomponent of the execution
         manager that collects method profiles for Java<a href="#*">*</a>
         methods compiled by a JIT or executed by the interpreter. DRL EM
         instantiates and configures profile collectors according to the
         settings of its configuration file.
      </p>
      <p>
         The profile collector can collect method profiles only for the methods
         compiled by a single JIT. To collect the same type of profile
         information for methods compiled by different JIT compilers, the
         execution manager uses different PC instances.
      </p>
      <p>
         After PC collects a method profile, subsequent JIT compilers in the
           <a href="#Recompilation">recompilation chain</a> can re-use this profile. A JIT can only use a
         collected method profile if it is explicitly indicated in the EM
         configuration file [<a href="#DRLEmGuide">4</a>]. If a JIT compiler is
         expected to use a method profile, the execution manager defines the
         <i>JIT role</i>, that is, configures the JIT compiler to generate or
         to use a specific profile in the file <code>include/open/em.h</code>
         using the following format:
      </p>
<pre>
enum EM_JIT_PC_Role {

 EM_JIT_PROFILE_ROLE_GEN=1,

 EM_JIT_PROFILE_ROLE_USE=2

 };
</pre>
      <p>
         With this model, instances of the compiler work independently of each
         other at run time. A JIT compiler can always use a PC handle to access
         the profile data that is assigned to be collected or used by this JIT
         compiler.<br />
          The profile collector does not trigger method recompilation. Instead,
         PC notifies the execution manager that a method profile is ready. To
         detect profile readiness, PC uses its own heuristics and configuration
         settings passed from EM during profile collector initialization. When
         the profile is ready, EM initiates recompilation of the method.
      </p>
      <h3>
         <a id="EM_PC" name="EM_PC"></a>EM_PC Interface
      </h3>
      <p>
         The <code>EM_PC</code> interface handles interaction between the
         execution manager and the profile collectors and consists of the
         following function groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The <i>time-based sampling support</i> interface (TBS) enables EM
            to register time-based sampling callbacks and to configure settings
            of method profiles. The profile collector checks readiness of
            method profiles by using this interface.
         </li>
         <li>
            The <i>profile-related events</i> interface enables PC to report to
            the execution manager when a method profile is ready.
         </li>
      </ul>

         PC
      </h3>
      <p>
         Currently, EM supports only statically linked profile collectors. To
         add a new profile collector, you must add the profile
         collector&rsquo;s code to the EM package, add the methods specific for
         the new profile collector to the profile access interface and enable
         EM to create the new profile collector. Follow this step-by-step
         instruction to plug in your new profile collector into the current EM
         package.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Extend the <code>ProfileCollector</code> abstract class and define
            all pure virtual methods. This class is in the
            <code>em/src/DrlProfileCollectionFramework.h</code> file.
         </li>
         <li>
            Add methods specific for the new profile collector to the
            <code>include/open/em_profile_access.h</code> file and register its
            new <code>EM_PCTYPE</code>.
         </li>
         <li>
            Adjust <code>em/src/DrlEMImpl.cpp::initProfileAccess()</code> to
            initialize access methods to the new profiler type with valid
            function pointers.
         </li>
         <li>
            Adjust <code>em/src/DrlEMImpl.cpp::createProfileCollector()</code>
            factory method to create the new profile collector type if its name
            is specified in the configuration file.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         As an example, you can use one of the two profiler collectors in the
         current EM package: the entry-backedge profile collector and the edge
         profile collector. The entry-backedge profile collector can work in
         the synchronous and asynchronous modes. The synchronous mode means
         that the profile is checked for readiness in a user Java<a
         href="#*">*</a> thread during code execution. The asynchronous mode
         means that the profile readiness is checked and hot methods are
         detected and recompiled in a separate profiler thread managed by EM.
      </p>
      <h2>
         <a id="Profiler_thread" name="Profiler_thread"></a>Profiler Thread
      </h2>
      <p>
         To enable a profile collector to check profile readiness
         asynchronously, the execution manager requires a special thread
         created by the VM core. This thread must be an ordinary Java<a
         href="#*">*</a> thread because method compilation may result in
         execution of JIT-compiled code during class resolution or side-effect
         analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
         After loading all core classes and before executing the method
         <code>main()</code>, the execution manager starts the recompilation
         thread. EM configures this thread to call back in a specified period
         of time. During this callback, the execution manger requests profile
         collectors to check profiles and runs method recompilation as
         required.
      </p>
      <p>
         The execution manager only starts the profiler thread when the profile
         collector requires asynchronous support. For example, no profiler
         thread support is needed when the profile check goes in parallel with
         code execution or is done by an external event from the PMU driver.
      </p>

         <a id="Recompilation" name="Recompilation"></a>Recompilation
      </h2>
      <p>
         For frequently executed methods, makes sense to recompile them 
         and to apply more aggressive optimizations. The execution manager determines the
         recompilation logic using <i>recompilation chains</i> that can connect
         multiple profile-compatible JIT compilers into a single recompilation
         queue. Recompilation chains are static and defined in the EM
         configuration file [<a href="#DRLEmGuide">4</a>]. A method is
         permanently matched against one recompilation chain.
      </p>
      <p>
         To compile a method for the first time, the execution manager calls
         the first JIT compiler in the chain. After profiling information about
         the method is collected, the next JIT in the chain is ready to
         recompile the method applying more aggressive optimizations. The data
         from the method profile can be used during method recompilation to
         adjust custom optimization parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
         Recompilation chains can be useful in different modes of VM operation,
         as illustrated in the examples below.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
         Example 1. Custom profiling mode
      </p>
      <p class="exampletext">
         If a compiler JIT1 does the initial method compilation with
         instrumentation enabled and a compiler JIT2 does the recompilation,
         you can avoid recompilation by redirecting certain methods to be
         initially compiled by a third compiler JIT3 without instrumentation.
         In this case, EM creates two compilation chains: the first chain
         contains JIT1 and JIT2, and the second chain contains JIT3. To select
         the chain for compiling a method, use method filters.<br />
          You may want to avoid instrumentation for class initializers or
         methods that already have a persistent profile collected during the
         previous session.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
         Example 2. Bug-fixing mode
      </p>
      <p class="exampletext">
         A stable compiler JIT1 is used for compiling all methods except
         problem ones, and another one JIT2 compiles problem methods
         only.<br />
          This mode can be useful for localizing specific problems in a new
         JIT.
      </p>
      <p>
         If multiple recompilation chains co-exist at run time, EM selects the
         appropriate recompilation chain to initially compile a method. Method
         filters associated with chains can configure the execution manager to
         use a specific chain for method compilation. Method filters can
         identify a method by its name, class name, signature or ordinal
         compilation number.

         Before loading an execution engine, the VM core creates an instance of
         the execution manager. This is the only instance used during the VM
         lifetime. Depending on its configuration, the execution manager
         initializes execution engines and profile collectors.
      </p>
      <p>
         During JIT compiler instantiation, the execution manager:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Provides the JIT with a name and registers a run-time JIT handle
            for it. The JIT can now use this name to distinguish its persistent
            settings from settings of other execution engines. A compiler can
            also use the handle to distinguish itself from other JIT compilers
            at run time.
         </li>
         <li>
            Configures the JIT to generate a new profile or to use an existing
            profile via the <a href="#EM_JIT">profile access interface</a>. 
            <p>
               When the JIT is configured to use or generate a profile, it
               checks the compatibility with the given profile type. If the JIT
               does not support the given profile type, it can reject profile
               generation or usage.
