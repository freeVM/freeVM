# @brief Configure Boot JVM.
#
# Shell script to configure which features are in the compiled code.
# This build happens in several phases:
#
# <ul>
# <li>
# <b>(1)</b> Pre-formatted documentation
# </li>
# <li>
# <b>(2)</b> Java Setup
# </li>
# <li>
# <b>(3)</b> C Compilation and Document Compilation Setup
# </li>
# <li>
# <b>(4)</b> Startup Library (bootclasspath) Java classes
# </li>
# <li>
# <b>(5)</b> Source code build-- Invokes 'make' which may be
#                         used for all further compilations.
# </li>
# </ul>
#
# Remember that if you add a Java source file, a C source or header
# file, or a shell script, you should run this script again so that
# the @b config directory roster locates the update.  This way,
# 'doxygen' will automatically incorporate it into the documentation
# suite.
#
# @todo HARMONY-6-config.sh-1 Support the following input parameter
#       format:
#
# Input:   [cputype [wordwidth [osname]]]
#
# These optional positional parameters contain specific token values,
# which may change from one release to the next.  Initially, they are
# as follows.  For current actual supported platform values, please
# refer to parsing of positional parms $1 and $2 and $3 below.
#
# <ul>
#         <li>cputype      Keyword for supported hardware platform.
#                          Initially @b sparc and @b intel
#
#         </li>
#         <li>wordwidth    Keyword for hardware word size.
#                          Initialiy either @b 32 and @b 64
#         </li>
#         <li>osname       Keyword for operating system name.
#                          Initially @b solaris and @b linux and
#                          @b windows and @b cygwin.
#         </li>
# </ul>
#
# These may evolve over time, and not every combination of these
# is valid.  The initial valid combinations are:
#
# (cputype, wordwidth, osname) ::=   one of these combinations:
#
# <ul>
#     <li>(sparc, 32, solaris)
#     </li>
#     <li>(sparc, 64, solaris)
#     </li>
#     <li>(sparc, 32, linux)
#     </li>
#     <li>(sparc, 64, linux)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 32, solaris)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 32, linux)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 64, solaris)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 64, linux)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 32, windows)
#     </li>
#     <li>(intel, 32, cygwin)
#     </li>
#     <li>(amd,   64, windows)... JDK for AMD64 coming soon from Sun.
#     </li>
# </ul>
