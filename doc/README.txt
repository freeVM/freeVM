Apache Harmony Federated Build
==============================

The ant script in trunk/ builds a complete
HDK and JRE from the classlib and DRLVM.

You need to have the full toolchain installed
in order to build.  See the classlib and DRLVM
respectively for this information.

Further, since this build includes AWT, you 
must have those currently non-automated 
prerequisites installed.

Please see

  classlib/depends/libs/build/README.txt

for more information.
