How to Run The Tests
====================

This is a work in progress.

The objective is to make it easy to run unit tests
for any part of the classlibrary, and be able to also
run the pile and do easy reporting.

This is a work in progress.

Requirements : 

1) Eclipse compiler and adapter.  http://www.eclipse.org
   
   Put these in your ant/lib

   jdtCompilerAdapter.jar
   org.eclipse.jdt.code_3.1.x.jar
   
   where x is arbitrary.  Right now, this can only be gotten
   from the 106MB eclipse download.  Sorry.
   
2) JUnit.jar - any modern version. http://www.junit.org
   
   Put this on your classpath because 
   we self-host to test (i.e. use both the Harmony class library
   and the external non-open source J9 VM that is available to us
   under an evaluation license
   
3) bcprov-jdk14-131.jar : from http://www.bouncycastle.org/

  Put in classpath - we'll fix this problem too.
  
4) J9 VM from IBM (evaluation)
    
      http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony/index.html
      
   Warning - this is not open source, and you must go through a minor 
   registration process.
   
   This is IBMs production VM that for now works with the Harmony classlib. 
   We will use this until our own VM efforts come up to speed.
   
   Installation - drop into deploy/jre/bin/default
   

 Once the prereqs are there : 
 
 1) Build the classlibrary : 
 
    $ cd make
    $ ant
    
    This should build and installl all java and native components
    
 2) Test : 
 
    in project root : 
    
    $ ant -f build-test.xml
    
    and wait.  You can find a html report in
    
       target/test_report/html/index.html
       
   when it's finished.
