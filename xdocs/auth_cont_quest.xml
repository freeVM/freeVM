PROPOSED

Part I :  Identification

   Please provide the following information

      Name : ___________________________________________
    E-mail : ___________________________________________

    Mailing address :
        ___________________________________________

        ___________________________________________
        ___________________________________________

     Employer :  ___________________________________________

Part II:  Access to Repositories

  The Project is committed to producing an implementation of Java that
  can be licensed freely under the Apache License.  To do this,
  we wish to know what, if any, previous exposure you have had
  to the source for any of the parts of a Java implementation
  including virtual machines, class libraries, tooling, etc.

  The following activities are not considered accessing the
  source code and would not generally disqualify you from
  committing to the related repository here at Apache Harmony

    a) Having a copy of src.jar (or equivalent) on a computer as long as you never
       viewed or edited the contents of the file.

    b) While running a debugger on a Java language program, having
       had occasion to step into the source code for the implementation
       as long as you did not attempt to understand or debug the
       implementation code itself.

    c) Having implemented "plug-ins" or other component software which
       interact with an implementation, but doing so only with reference
       to the published service provider interfaces.

    d) Have written or executed test cases that probed the behavior
       of an implementation as long as you did so with reference
       only to published specifications and interfaces.

   The following is a list of the components of the project each
   labeled with an ID (ex. JVM-1):

    If you have answered yes to any question above, and that implementation is
    not available under a recognized Open Source license, you may not be an
    contributor to the related component of Apache Harmony unless the
    copyright owner of that implementation either:

     a) submits the implementation to this project under the Software Grant or
        the Corporate Contribution License Agreement (the CCLA);

     b) if the copyright owner is your current employer, signs a CCLA and
       lists you as a designated employee; or
