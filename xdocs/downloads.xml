		Apache Harmony's primary goal is a complete Java SE 5 implemention, including
        virtual machine, class library areas, and all related and common tooling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Access to <a href="svn.html">the code repository</a> is available to all, and we have
		<a href="documentation/documentation.html">instructions</a> for building the 
		virtual machine code and <a href="documentation/build_classlib.html">
		building the class library code</a>.
	</p>

    <p>
        However, if you don't want to build it, we now offer snapshots of our JRE and
        <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/subcomponents/classlibrary/hdk.html">HDK</a>
        for Linux and Windows x86-based platforms.
    </p>

    <subsection name="Snapshot Builds">

    <p>
        We offer the following
        <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/">snapshots</a> :
    </p>

    <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong>

    <p>
        The JRE lets you build and run your Java programs.  Note that it's safest to set JAVA_HOME to the root directory
        of the distribution, and put the bin/ directory on your PATH.
    </p>

        <li>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-linux.tar.gz">Latest Linux JRE (tar.gz)</a>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-linux.tar.gz.md5">(MD5)</a>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-linux.tar.gz.sha">(SHA)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-windows.zip">Latest Windows JRE (zip)</a>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-windows.zip.md5">(MD5)</a>
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/latest-harmony-jre-windows.zip.sha">(SHA)</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Harmony Development Kit (HDK)</strong>

    <p>
        The HDK is targetted at Harmony developers.  It includes the pre-built class library and VM binaries,
        necessary include files, test cases, and dependencies. It is not a replacement for the common JDK.
    </p>

	<p>
	These are not official releases of the Apache Software Foundation, nor are they
	complete or compatible with the Java specification.  They are snapshots provided
    to make testing and experimentation easier.
