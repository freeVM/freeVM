	<p>
	In order to make Apache Harmony easier to experiement with, we are making 
	<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/"> snapshot builds</a>
	available.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Please note that they are not releases, but arbitrary point in time snapshots that
	will be updated as the committers see fit.  This will usually happen when signficant
	features or stability has been added.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Again, these are not official releases of the Apache Software Foundation, nor are they
	complete or compatible with the Java specification.  They are provided to make testing 
	and experimentation easier.
