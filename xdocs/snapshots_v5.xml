    <section name="Snapshot Builds and Test Results for Harmony 5.0">
      <p>
        We offer the following Harmony binaries for the Linux and Windows platforms:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) lets you run your Java programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Java Development Kit (JDK) lets you build and run your Java programs.
            It includes javac and other standard JDK tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Harmony Development Kit (HDK) is targeted at Harmony developers.
            It includes the pre-built class library and VM binaries, necessary
            include files, and dependencies. It is not a replacement for the common
            JDK. We plan to include the Harmony test suite in the HDK in future.
            Please see
            <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-950">HARMONY-950</a> and
            <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-984">HARMONY-984</a>
            for details and current progress.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not official releases of the Apache Software Foundation, nor are they
        complete or compatible with the Java specification. They are snapshots provided
        to make testing and experimentation easier. Results of automatic testing are
        available.
      </p>
      <p class="note">Note</p>
      <p class="notetext">
        We recommend that you set <code>JAVA_HOME to</code> the
        root directory of the distribution, and put the <code>bin/</code> directory
        on your <code>PATH</code>.
      </p>
