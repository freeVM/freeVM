            <p>
                The Apache Harmony project is dedicated to producing a codebase that
                has clear IP pedigree and protects the IP rights of others. As part
                of this effort, we are developing and using tools that help us examine
                code in a more effient way. Below are some tools that we either have
                created, or are listing to provide awareness. The Apache Harmony project
                or the ASF does not endorse or promote any of these tools, projects
                or commercial organizations, and does not make any claims as to
                suitability, accuracy or dependability.

              <subsection name="Apache Harmony Keyword Scanner">
                <p>
                    Keyword scanning is a simple technique to find "the code you never
                    knew you had." By searching for a set of well chosen keywords (like
                    "copyright", "license" etc), you can discover code that may not
                    be redistributable (you have the license to use by not re-distribute
                    or re-license), or that you didn't want to contribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Apache Harmony Keyword Scanner is a new contribution that can be found
                    here:
