        This guideline covers a wide range of issues but not all of them.
        If you cannot do one of the steps, then write a comment to the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use your common sense!

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Explicitly state the expected behavior and the</li>
            actual behavior of Harmony code. Use links to specs, rfcs, etc.
        <li>Try to create as small test case as possible. A patch
            to test will be highly appreciated.</li>
        <li>Provide max. information about steps necessary to recreate the bug.
            If a patch for the test has not been supplied, provide as much
            diagnostic information about the failure as possible (stack trace,
            failure output, expected output etc).</li>
        <li>Remember to use issue links if applicable.</li>

        Depending on the type of issue, do the following:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Issue is probably a non-bug difference, not a bug or invalid:
            <ol>
                <li>Discuss on the dev list.</li>
                <li>Add a link to the discussion thread as a comment to issue.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Issue is a bug:
            <ol>
                <li>Notify the community that you started investigation by adding
                a comment to the issue and send a message to dev list. If you cannot
                produce a patch, add another comment with the results of your investigation.</li>
                <li>If reporter did not provide a patch to test:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Try to create a patch to test.</li>
                        <li>If you cannot produce a patch, write a comment about it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Create a patch to fix the issue. Any concerns? Discuss on the dev list. 
                Add a link to discussion as a comment.</li>
                <li>All the pacthes (test and fix) should be relative to the directory where 
                the main build.xml is: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/harmony/enhanced/classlib/trunk.
                Or to the module root directory.</li>
                <li>Test and fix patches should be in different files.</li>
                <li>If the patch requires to add, remove or move some files in the repository, add the appropriate script.</li>
                <li>Check that all unit tests pass.</li>
                <li>If it is an application-oriented issue, check the application.</li>
                <li>Remember to use issue links if applicable.</li>
