    <section name="Good Issue Resolution Guideline">
    <p>
      This guideline provides step-by-step instructions on reporting, resolving 
      and closing issues. If you cannot do one of the steps, then write a comment to the issue.
    </p>
       
    <subsection name="Reporting Issues">
    
    <ol>
        <li>State the expected behavior and the
            actual behavior of Harmony code explicitly. Use links to 
            specifications, references, etc.</li>
        <li>Create a test case as small as possible. A patch
            to test is highly appreciated.</li>
        <li>Provide maximum information about steps necessary to reproduce the bug.
            If a patch for the test has not been supplied, provide as much
            diagnostic information about the failure as possible: stack trace,
            failure output, expected output, etc.</li>
        <li>Use issue links if applicable.</li>
        <li>Check the issue resolution, when it is committed. Add a comment.</li>
    </ol>
   
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Resolving Issues">
      <p>To resolve an issue, define its type first.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>If the issue is a non-bug difference, not a bug or invalid,
            you should do the following:</dt>
            <dd><ol>
                <li>Discuss the issue on the 
                <a href="mailing.html">developer mailing list</a>.</li>
                <li>Add a link to the discussion thread as a comment to the issue.</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
        
       <dt>If the issue is a bug, you should do the following:</dt>
            <dd><ol>
                <li>
                  Notify the community that you started investigation by adding
                  a comment to the issue and send a message to the 
                  <a href="mailing.html">developer mailing list</a>.
                  If you cannot create a patch, add another comment with your 
                  investigation results.</li>
                <li>If reporter did not provide a patch to test:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to create a patch to test.</li>
                        <li>If you cannot create a patch, write a comment about it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a patch to fix the issue. If you have any questions,
                  discuss them on the <a href="mailing.html">developer mailing list</a>.
                  Add a link to the discussion as a comment.</li>
                <li>All pacthes, such as tests and fixes, should be relative to the directory where 
                the main <code>build.xml</code> is:<br/>
                <code>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/classlib/trunk</code>,<br/>
                or to the module root directory.</li>
                <li>Test and fix patches should be in different files.</li>
                <li>If the patch requires adding, removing or moving some files in the repository, 
                provide the appropriate script.</li>
                <li>Check that all unit tests pass. For reference results, see 
                <a href="http://people.apache.org/~varlax/harmony-integrity/">up-to-date HEAD integrity status</a>.</li>
                <li>If the issue is application-oriented, check the application.</li>
                <li>Use issue links if applicable.</li>
            </ol>
