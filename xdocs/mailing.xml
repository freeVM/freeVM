                There are currently three publicly available mailing lists for Harmony:
            </p>
                <dl>
                  <dt><strong>dev@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
                  <dd>The Apache developers' primary mailing list for discussion of issues
                      and changes related to the project (<em>dev@harmony.apache.org</em>).
                      Subscription to the list is open, but only subscribers
                      can post directly to the list.
                  </dd>

                  <dt><strong>commits@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
                  <dd>All of the Apache projects are maintained in shared information
                      repositories using SVN.
                      Only some of the Apache developers (the committers) have
                      write access to these repositories; everyone has read access via
                      anonymous SVN. 
                  </dd>
                  <dt><strong>private@harmony.apache.org</strong></dt>
                  <dd>The Apache Harmony PMC's private mailing list for discussion of issues
                      that are inappropriate for public discussion, such as legal, personal,
                      or security issues prior to a published fix. Subscription to the list
                      is only open to Apache Harmony PMC members.

                    The developer mailing list is used by the developers to discuss
                    plans, make decisions, vote on technical issues, etc. This
                    list has a higher volume, though some conversations take place on

                    help build one homogeneous community. It is expected that at some point in the
                    near future, we will be splitting off into technical domains.
