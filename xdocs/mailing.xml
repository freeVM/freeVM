<section name="Apache Harmony Mailling Lists">

<p><i>The following terms are currently PROPOSED</i></p>

<p>
Apache Harmony mailing lists operate under the following terms :
</p>

<blockquote>
This forum has been created for public communication about projects
of The Apache Software Foundation (the "Foundation"), a Delaware
nonprofit corporation classified as a public charity under 501(c)(3).
All communication intentionally submitted to the Foundation on this
forum is considered a Contribution to the Foundation unless otherwise
noted in the communication. The terms and conditions that apply to
your Contributions are defined by either a contributor license
agreement (CLA) signed by you and/or your employer or, if no such CLA
is on file at the Foundation, by the terms and conditions of
Contributions as defined by the Apache License, Version 2.0.
</blockquote>
>
 
<p>
Further :
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
If you do not wish your post to be a Contribution, please do not post it.  However, in the
event that you do, please mark as "NOT A CONTRIBUTION" at the top of the posting.
</li>
<li>
Do not post any code that is not your original work, or code that you do not have 
clear authorization to contribute.
</li>
<li>
Do not engage in detailed discussion of any implementation that you have been exposed 
to unless such implementation is available to everyone under an open source license or is
your own implementation.
</li>
<li>
Under no circumstances will any committer accept code for inclusion in our SVN 
repository contributed on the mailing list unless
it is from an Authorized Contributor, as defined <a href="">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are currently three publicly available mailing lists for Harmony :
</p>

plans, make decisions, vote on technical issues, etc.  It also gets
change notices whenever issues are added to or updated in JIRA.  This
list has a higher volume, though some conversations take place on
    <a href="get-involved.html#irc-channel">IRC</a> as
well.</p>
