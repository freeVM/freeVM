<section name="So, What Can We Do Now?">

<p>
The problem with building something as fundamental as a JRE is how to show
progress to the community, so that people will begin to use it, give feedback
and most importantly contribute bugfixes and additions.  Although we have 
a list of the packages we believe are complete, are in progress, and 
are not started, it's more useful to answer the question <i>So what can it do?</i>
</p>

<p>
 The following is a list of useful things you can do with Harmony. Please note 
 that Harmony is a work in progress - it is not complete.  Therefore we do not
 in any way assert that it is a compatible implementation of Java.  (But we're 
 on our way...)
 </p>
 
<p>
To test the examples below, please do the following : 

<ol>
<li>Either :
   <ul>
      <li>Build the classlibraries</li>
      <li>Get a pre-built snapshot of the class libraries </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>
Get the J9 evaluation VM from IBM.  (We'll use this until our own
VM efforts make a little more progress).  Install according to
directions in the deploy directory of the class library build.
</li>
<li>
Set JAVA_HOME to either nothing or the deploy/jre directory of Harmony.
</li>
<li>
You may need to modify your CLASSPATH to include "." (current directory)
</li>
</ol>
