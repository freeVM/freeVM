<section name="So, What Can We Do Now?">

<p>
The problem with building something as fundamental as a JRE is how to show
progress to the community, so that people will begin to use it, give feedback
and most importantly contribute bugfixes and additions.  Although we have 
<a href="subcomponents/classlibrary/status.html">a
list of the packages</a> we believe are complete, are in progress, and 
are not started, it's more useful to answer the question <i>So what can it do?</i>
</p>

<p>
We maintain a list on the project Wiki of
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/Application_Status">applications that have
been tried</a> on Harmony code.
