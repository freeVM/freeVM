  <section name="Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE">

    <p>
      <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE.</big>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Apache Harmony is
        the Java SE project of the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
      Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
      Java Platform Standard Edition!
    </p>

   <p>
      The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
      of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of :
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
          A compatible, independent implementation of the Java SE 5
          JDK under the Apache License v2
      </li>
      <li>
          A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
          architecture.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
       We aim to support wide range of different platforms.  The main criteria
       for whether a particular platform is supported or not is the involvement
       of people in running tests on regular base, reporting build status, finding
       and fixing bugs for that platform, and so on.  We have
       <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/Platforms_to_Run_Harmony_Development_Kit_on">a
       list of platforms</a> we are actively maintaining at the moment.
   </p>

    <p>
        How are we doing?  We're making steady progress : 
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>JRE and HDK snapshots <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/">available</a> </li>
        <li>
            JRE can run popular programs like Apache Tomcat, Eclipse, Maven, Derby, Ant
        </li>
        <li>More than 95% of Java 5 API complete. (not compatible, just completed)</li>
        <li>More than 1.25 Million Lines of Code</li>

            <strong>JDK Snapshot Available</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Apache Harmony now has a JDK snapshot available, that includes javac, keytool,
                and others.  While not complete, it's our first step towards the standard
                JDK distribution format expected by developers.  For more information, please
                see our <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page.

            <strong>Linux x86-64 (64-bit) Snapshots Available</strong>
            <blockquote>
                We now are including support for the x86-64 architecture under Linux. 
                For more information, please

            <strong>Apache Harmony: Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Apache Harmony is now a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation. 
                On October 25th, the Board of Directors voted to make Apache Harmony a
                top-level project, and on October 29th the Apache Incubator PMC voted to
                graduate Harmony from the Apache Incubator, having satisfied the Incubator's
                requirements for community governance and IP oversight.  We're in the process
                of transitioning our resources and infrastructure over, so please be patient
                while we do our move.

   <b>Open Source Java: Interview with an Apache Harmony Project Founder</b>
   <blockquote>
     Apache Harmony is a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation.
     The Harmony project mission is to create a compatible,
     independent implementation of J2SE 5 under the Apache License v2, and "create a
     community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library) architecture to allow
     independent implementations to share runtime components, and allow independent
     innovation in runtime components."
