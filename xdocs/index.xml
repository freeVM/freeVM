<section name="Welcome to Apache Harmony">

    <p>
    Welcome to Apache Harmony, the J2SE  project of the
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
    Please help us make this a world class, certified J2SE implementation!
    </p>

   <p>
   Note : Apache Harmony is an effort undergoing incubation at the 
   Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly 
   accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
   communications, and decision making process have stabilized in 
   a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
   incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
   or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
</p>
    <p>
    The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
    of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with :
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
        Create a compatible, independent implementation of J2SE 5
        under the Apache License v2
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
        architecture to allow independent implementations to share runtime
         components, and allow independent innovation in runtime components

    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Java Security Code Contribution</strong>
    <blockquote>
      On December 30th, 2005 the Apache Harmony project accepted additional
      class library code into the project.  The code had been contributed by
      Mikhail Loenko on behalf of Intel corp.  The new class library code
      includes security, cryptography, javax.net and unit tests.  Thanks to
      Mikhail and his collegues in the Intel Managed Runtime Division!

    <strong>VM Interface and Core Classes Contribution</strong>
    <blockquote>
      IBM has offered the Apache Harmony project a set of core 
      Java classes and an implementation of a VM/class library
      interface.  Tim Ellison wrote : 
      
      <blockquote>
      
      I'm delighted to be able to make a code contribution to the Harmony
project on behalf of IBM.  The code comprises a concrete implementation
of the interface between virtual machine and class library that we have
been discussing recently, together with a set of core Java classes.
      </blockquote>
      This contribution is sufficient to run Ant and the Eclipse Java 
      compiler, to provide a basic self-hosting environment.  IBM also
      made a version of their J9 VM 
      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony">
      available</a> for use by the project in evaluating this contribution.
      Thanks Tim and IBM :)

    <strong>"Bootstrap JVM" Contributed to Apache Harmony</strong>
    <blockquote>
        Daniel Lydickto the Harmony project of a basic Java 
        Virtual Machine entitled the "Apache Harmony Bootstrap JVM." 
        Dan offered the VM with the following goals in mind :
        <ul>
        <li>Basic platform for learning about VMs</li>
        <li>Boostrap and runtime framework for our eventual 'production' VM</li>
        <li>Help spur architectural discussion about core
            component designs</li>
        </ul>
        Thanks Dan!

    <strong>Source for JCVM Contributed to Apache Harmony</strong>
    <blockquote>
        Archie Cobbs has offered for contribution to the Apache Harmony project
        a copy of the <a href="http://jcvm.sourceforge.net/">JCVM</a>
        codebase.  Come and help us build on this interesting
        VM.  Thanks Archie!
