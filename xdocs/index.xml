<section name="Welcome to Apache Harmony">

    <p>
    Welcome to Apache Harmony, the J2SE  project of the
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
    Please help us make this a world class, certified J2SE implementation!
    </p>

   <p>
   Note : Apache Harmony is an effort undergoing incubation at the 
   Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly 
   accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
   communications, and decision making process have stabilized in 
   a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
   incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
   or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
</p>
    <p>
    The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
    of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with :
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
        Create a compatible, independent implementation of J2SE 5
        under the Apache License v2
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
        architecture to allow independent implementations to share runtime
         components, and allow independent innovation in runtime components

    </li>
</ul>
