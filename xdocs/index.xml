    <p>
	    <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE.</big>
    </p>
    <p>
        Apache Harmony is
        the Java SE project of the
	    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
	    Java Platform Standard Edition!
    </p>

   <p>
	    The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
	    of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of :
   </p>
   <ul>
	    <li>
	        A compatible, independent implementation of Java SE 5
	        under the Apache License v2
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
	        architecture.
	    </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
       Please see the following "Getting Started" guides :
   </p>

        How are we doing?  We're making steady progress : 
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>JRE and HDK snapshots <a href="http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/">available</a> </li>
        <li>
            JRE can run popular programs like Apache Tomcat (with bugs, of course...)
        </li>
        <li>More that 90% of Java 5 API complete. (not compatible, just completed)</li>
        <li>More that 1.25 Million Lines of Code</li>
    </ol>

            <strong>New JRE and HDK Snapshots Posted</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Our <a href="downloads.html">latest snapshots</a> have
                lots of new fixes and features.  The VM has a new GC,
                almost complete JVMTI, and now can co-exist with the IBM J9 VM in
                the Harmony JRE structure.  Our classlibrary continues to grow with new
                classes, notably CORBA, thanks to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/yoko">
                Apache Yoko</a>.  Also, the classlibrary includes many new fixes and updates.
                Choose the JRE to test your favorite applications and give us feeback on how
                we are doing, or use the HDK to enable faster development of the Harmony classlibrary.

        <blockquote>
            Harmony now
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/">offers a snapshot</a>
            of it's JRE and HDK builds.
            The JRE snapshot is our in-progress Java Runtime Environment,
            including both the virtual machine and classlibrary.  Note that
            this isn't stable, complete or compatible software.  However,
            you can use this to run your favorite Java applications and
            help the project find and fix bugs, and help direct our efforts
            to complete the most popular parts of the classlibrary first.  The HDK
            snapshot is a developers build, complete with classlibrary jars and
            native libraries, header files, and build scripts.

   <b>Open Source Java: Interview with an Apache Harmony Project Founder</b>
   <blockquote>
     Harmony, an open source Java implementation, is currently in incubator status at the
     Apache Software Foundation. The Harmony project mission is to create a compatible,
     independent implementation of J2SE 5 under the Apache License v2, and "create a
     community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library) architecture to allow
     independent implementations to share runtime components, and allow independent
     innovation in runtime components."

<section name="Incubator Notice">
    <p>
        <i>Note</i> : Apache Harmony is an effort undergoing incubation at the
        Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly
        accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
        communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
        a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
        incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
        or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
        fully endorsed by the ASF.
