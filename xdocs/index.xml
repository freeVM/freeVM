      <p>
        <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE.</big>
      </p>

      <p>
        Apache Harmony is
        the Java SE project of the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
        Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
        Java Platform Standard Edition!
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
        of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A compatible, independent implementation of the Java SE 5
          JDK under the Apache License v2
        </li>
        <li>
          A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
          architecture.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We aim to support wide range of different platforms. The main criteria
        for whether a particular platform is supported or not is the involvement
        of people in running tests on regular basis, reporting build status, finding
        and fixing bugs for that platform, and so on. We have
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/Platforms_to_Run_Harmony_Development_Kit_on">
          a
          list of platforms
        </a> we are actively maintaining at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
