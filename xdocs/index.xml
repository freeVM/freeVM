    <section name="Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE">

      <p>
        <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE.</big>
      </p>

      <p>
        Apache Harmony is
        the Java SE project of the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
        Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
        Java Platform Standard Edition!
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
        of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A compatible, independent implementation of the Java SE 5
          JDK under the Apache License v2
        </li>
        <li>
          A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
          architecture.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We aim to support wide range of different platforms. The main criteria
        for whether a particular platform is supported or not is the involvement
        of people in running tests on regular basis, reporting build status, finding
        and fixing bugs for that platform, and so on. We have
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/Platforms_to_Run_Harmony_Development_Kit_on">
          a
          list of platforms
        </a> we are actively maintaining at the moment.
      </p>

        <dt>5.0 M3 stable build has been released</dt>
        <dd>
          The build is targeted primarily to improving overall stability and
          performance. This build contains the following enhancements:
          an innovative fast byte code verifier, lazy resolution in all JIT
          modes on IA32 platforms, support for Java6.0 classes in DRLVM.<p/>
          Other areas that were improved include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bytecode mapping in JIT - exception stack traces became more
              comprehensive
            </li>
            <li>
              Threading support was partially re-factored towards improvement
              of reliability and maintainability
            </li>
            <li>
              JIT-based JVMTI debug mode speed up by a factor of 3
            </li>
            <li>
              Stability of Swing and AWT code on Windows
            </li>
         </ul>
         The build is available for
         <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/download.cgi#M3-r580985">download</a>.
         Please send your feedback to

        <dt>Harmony 5.0 M2 Available</dt>
        <dd>
          We are pleased to announce the second stable build "5.0 M2".
          In this build overall stability was improved, switch to GCv5 was made,
          a lot of JIT optimizations were implemented, memory consumption was
          significantly improved, API completeness came to 99.06% (without endorsed specs)
          and many bugs were fixed. Apache Harmony encourage users to
          <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/download.cgi#M2-r551077">download</a>
          and try the runtime or development kit, and report their experiences to
          <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/mailing.html">the Harmony mailing list</a>.

        <dt>First Milestone Available Now</dt>
        <dd>
          Apache Harmony are pleased to announce the the first stable build "5.0 M1".  The code,
          which was previously made available as "snapshot r533500", underwent additional testing
          after a period of stabalization in the ongoing development of a full release.  Apache Harmony
          5.0 M1 represents our best build so far, and we encourage users to
          <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/download.cgi">download</a> and try the runtime
          or development kit, and report their experiences to
          <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/mailing.html">the Harmony mailing list</a>.

        <dt>Harmony Classlib Enabled Version of JRockit VM Available for Project Use</dt>
        <dd>
          BEA announced the <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/jrockit/jrockitVM">availability</a> of
          an evaluation version of JRockit, their world-class JVM, that works
          with the Apache Harmony class library. Distibuted by BEA under a binary, evaluation-only
          license, this not only demonstrates the portablity of the
          <a href="subcomponents/classlibrary/index.html">Apache Harmony class library</a>,
          it also adds a valuable tool to help us as we continue building our independent implementation
          of Java SE.
