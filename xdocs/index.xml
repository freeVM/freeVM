	    <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE.</big>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b><i>Big News : Apache Harmony is a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation!
           See below for more information.</i></b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Apache Harmony is
        the Java SE project of the
	    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
	    Java Platform Standard Edition!
    </p>

   <p>
	    The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
	    of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of :
   </p>
   <ul>
	    <li>
	        A compatible, independent implementation of the Java SE 5
	        JDK under the Apache License v2
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
	        architecture.
	    </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
       We aim to support wide range of different platforms.  The main criteria
       for whether a particular platform is supported or not is the involvement
       of people in running tests on regular base, reporting build status, finding
       and fixing bugs for that platform, and so on.  We have
       <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/Platforms_to_Run_Harmony_Development_Kit_on">a
       list of platforms</a> we are actively maintaining at the moment.
   </p>

   <p>
       Please see the following "Getting Started" guides :
   </p>

            <strong>Apache Harmony : Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Apache Harmony is now a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation. 
                On October 25th, the Board of Directors voted to make Apache Harmony a
                top-level project, and on October 29th the Apache Incubator PMC voted to
                graduate Harmony from the Apache Incubator, having satisfied the Incubator's
                requirements for community governance and IP oversight.  We're in the process
                of transitioning our resources and infrastructure over, so please be patient
                while we do our move.

            <strong>New JRE and HDK Snapshots Posted</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Our <a href="downloads.html">latest snapshots</a> have
                lots of new fixes and features.  The VM has a new GC,
                almost complete JVMTI, and now can co-exist with
                <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony">the IBM VME</a> in
                the Harmony JRE structure.  Our classlibrary continues to grow with new
                classes, notably CORBA, thanks to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/yoko">
                Apache Yoko</a>.  Also, the classlibrary includes many new fixes and updates.
                Choose the JRE to test your favorite applications, and
                <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/mailing.html">give us feedback</a> on how
                we are doing, or use the HDK to enable faster development of the Harmony classlibrary.

        <blockquote>
            Harmony now
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/">offers a snapshot</a>
            of it's JRE and HDK builds.
            The JRE snapshot is our in-progress Java Runtime Environment,
            including both the virtual machine and classlibrary.  Note that
            this isn't stable, complete or compatible software.  However,
            you can use this to run your favorite Java applications and
            help the project find and fix bugs, and help direct our efforts
            to complete the most popular parts of the classlibrary first.  The HDK
            snapshot is a developers build, complete with classlibrary jars and
            native libraries, header files, and build scripts.

   <blockquote>
     Apache Harmony is a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation.
     The Harmony project mission is to create a compatible,
     independent implementation of J2SE 5 under the Apache License v2, and "create a
     community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library) architecture to allow
     independent implementations to share runtime components, and allow independent
     innovation in runtime components."
