    <p>
	    <big>Welcome to Apache Harmony,</big> the Java SE project of the
	    <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    Please help us make this a world class, certified implementation of the
	    Java Platform Standard Edition!
    </p>

   <p>
	    The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community
	    of those interested in runtime platforms tasked with creation of :
   </p>
   <ul>
	    <li>
	        A compatible, independent implementation of Java SE 5
	        under the Apache License v2
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        A community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library)
	        architecture.
	    </li>
   </ul>

        How are we doing?  We're making steady progress :

    <ol>
        <li>JRE and HDK snapshots <a href="http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/">available</a> </li>
        <li>
            JRE can run popular programs like Apache Tomcat (with bugs, of course...)
        </li>
        <li>More that 78% of Java 5 API complete. (not compatible, just completed)</li>
        <li>More that 1.2 Million Lines of Code as of July 1, 2006</li>

        <strong>HDK and JRE Snapshots Available</strong>
        <blockquote>
            Harmony now
            <a href="http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/">offers a snapshot</a>
            of it's JRE and HDK builds.
            The JRE snapshot is our in-progress Java Runtime Environment,
            including both the virtual machine and classlibrary.  Note that
            this isn't stable, complete or compatible software.  However,
            you can use this to run your favorite Java applications and
            help the project find and fix bugs, and help direct our efforts
            to complete the most popular parts of the classlibrary first.  The HDK
            snapshot is a developers build, complete with classlibrary jars and
            native libraries, header files, and build scripts.

	    <strong>New class library snapshot build available</strong>
	    <blockquote>
	      A new stable snapshot of the class libraries code is available
	      for download from the
	      <a href="downloads.html">Harmony downloads page</a>.
	      These are made available for people to evaluate and experiment
	      with the code.  This snapshot contains the recently integrated
	      Swing, AWT, and Java2D code.  As always, please report bugs
	      (and successes!) to the
          <a href="mailing.html">Harmony developers mailing list</a>.

	    <strong>AWT, Java2D and Swing Code Contribution</strong>
	    <blockquote>
            On May 30th, 2006 the Apache Harmony project received a
            <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-528">substantial
            contribution</a> of class library code into the project.  The code for
            AWT, Java2D, and Swing implementation has been contributed by Alexey
            Petrenko on behalf of Intel corp.  The full announcement can be found
            on the
            <a href="mailing.html">Harmony developers mailing list</a>.  Thanks to
            Alexey and his collegues in the Intel Middleware Products Division!

   <b>Open Source Java: Interview with an Apache Harmony Project Founder</b>
   <blockquote>
     Harmony, an open source Java implementation, is currently in incubator status at the
     Apache Software Foundation. The Harmony project mission is to create a compatible,
     independent implementation of J2SE 5 under the Apache License v2, and "create a
     community-developed modular runtime (VM and class library) architecture to allow
     independent implementations to share runtime components, and allow independent
     innovation in runtime components."

<section name="Incubator Notice">
    <p>
        <i>Note</i> : Apache Harmony is an effort undergoing incubation at the
        Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly
        accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
        communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
        a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
        incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
        or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
        fully endorsed by the ASF.
