        <section name="Apache Harmony Source Code">
            <p>
                We provide tarballs of the source code, you can just <a href="download.cgi">download</a> 
                either stable build or nightly snapshot and 
                <a href="http://people.apache.org/~chunrong/snapshots/snapshots_summary.html">
                ascertain</a> that it passed sanity testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you want to be on the bleeding-edge of the development effort, access repository.
                The Harmony project uses the
                <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> version control
                system.  If you're new to Subversion, you can check out the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">online book</a> about Subversion.</p>
                <p class="note">Note</p>
                <p class="notetext">Currently, we are using Subversion 1.1.x (there are separate
                versions of the book covering 1.0 and 1.1).</p>

            <subsection name="Web Access to Subversion">
                <p>
                    If you just want to browse the source code, you can use the
                    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/harmony/?root=Apache-SVN">
                        ViewCVS
                        web interface
                    </a> to Subversion. This is current at all times.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Normal Subversion Access">
                <p>
                    Anyone can check code out of Subversion repository. You only need to specify a
                    username and password in order to update the Subversion repository, and only
                    Harmony committers have the permissions to do that. We run Subversion
                    over standard HTTP/HTTPS, so hopefully you won't have problems with intervening
                    firewalls.
                </p>

                <h3>Check out from Subversion</h3>
                <p>Again, anyone can do this. Use a command like:</p>
                <pre>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/trunk</pre>

                <h3>Commit Changes to Subversion</h3>
                <p>
                    Any Harmony committer should have a shell account on
                    <code>svn.apache.org</code>. Before you can commit, you'll need to set a
                    Subversion password for yourself. To do that, log in to
                    <code>svn.apache.org</code> and run the command <code>svnpasswd</code>.
                </p>
                <p>Once your password is set, you can use a command like this to commit:</p>
                <pre>svn commit</pre>
                <p>
                    If Subversion can't figure out your username, you can tell it
                    explicitly:
                </p>
                <pre>svn --username you commit</pre>
                <p>
                    Subversion will prompt you for a password, and once you enter it once, it
                    will remember it for you.</p>
                    <p class="note">Note</p>
                    <p class="notetext">This is the password you configured with
                    <code>svnpasswd</code>, not your shell or other password.</p>
                    <p class="notetext">Write-access assumes HTTPS connection,
                    so you may need to perform <code>svn switch</code> prior to committing.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Code Integrity Status">
                <p>
                    If you wonder how healthy the code is, check up
                    <a href="http://people.apache.org/~chunrong/harmony-integrity/">
                    integrity status</a> which is
                    automatically tracked for all supported platforms.
