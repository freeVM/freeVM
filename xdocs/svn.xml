        <section name="Apache Harmony Source Code">
            <p>
                The Harmony project uses the
                <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> version control
                system.  If you're new to Subversion, you can check out the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">online book</a> about Subversion.</p>
                <p class="note">Note</p>
                <p class="notetext">Currently, we are using Subversion 1.1.x (there are separate
                versions of the book covering 1.0 and 1.1).</p>

            <subsection name="Web Access to Subversion">
                <p>
                    If you just want to browse the source code, you can use the
                    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/harmony/?root=Apache-SVN">
                        ViewCVS
                        web interface
                    </a> to Subversion. This is current at all times.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Normal Subversion Access">
                <p>
                    Anyone can check code out of Subversion. You only need to specify a
                    username and password in order to update the Subversion repository, and only
                    Harmony committers have the permissions to do that. We run Subversion
                    over standard HTTPS, so hopefully you won't have problems with intervening
                    firewalls.
                </p>

                <h3>Check out from Subversion</h3>
                <p>Again, anyone can do this. Use a command like:</p>
                <pre>svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/trunk</pre>

                <h3>Commit Changes to Subversion</h3>
                <p>
                    Any Harmony committer should have a shell account on
                    <code>svn.apache.org</code>. Before you can commit, you'll need to set a
                    Subversion password for yourself. To do that, log in to
                    <code>svn.apache.org</code> and run the command <code>svnpasswd</code>.
                </p>
                <p>Once your password is set, you can use a command like this to commit:</p>
                <pre>svn commit</pre>
                <p>
                    If Subversion can't figure out your username, you can tell it
                    explicitly:
                </p>
                <pre>svn --username you commit</pre>
                <p>
                    Subversion will prompt you for a password, and once you enter it once, it
                    will remember it for you.</p>
                    <p class="note">Note</p>
                    <p class="notetext">This is the password you configured with
                    <code>svnpasswd</code>, not your shell or other password.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Code Integrity Status">
                <p>
                    If you wonder how healthy the code is, check up
                    <a href="http://people.apache.org/~varlax/harmony-integrity/">
                    integrity status</a> which is
                    automatically tracked for all supported platforms.
