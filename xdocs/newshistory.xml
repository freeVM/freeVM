	    <strong>Java Security Code Contribution</strong>
	    <blockquote>
	      On December 30th, 2005 the Apache Harmony project accepted additional
	      class library code into the project.  The code had been contributed by
	      Mikhail Loenko on behalf of Intel corp.  The new class library code
	      includes security, cryptography, javax.net and unit tests.  Thanks to
	      Mikhail and his collegues in the Intel Managed Runtime Division!

	    <strong>VM Interface and Core Classes Contribution</strong>
	    <blockquote>
	      IBM has offered the Apache Harmony project a set of core 
	      Java classes and an implementation of a VM/class library
	      interface.  Tim Ellison wrote : 
	      
	      <blockquote>I'm delighted to be able to make a code contribution to the
			Harmony project on behalf of IBM.  The code comprises a concrete implementation
			of the interface between virtual machine and class library that we have
			been discussing recently, together with a set of core Java classes.

	      This contribution is sufficient to run Ant and the Eclipse Java 
	      compiler, to provide a basic self-hosting environment.  IBM also
	      made a version of their J9 VM 
	      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony">
	      available</a> for use by the project in evaluating this contribution.
	      Thanks Tim and IBM :)

	        Virtual Machine entitled the "Apache Harmony Bootstrap JVM." 
	        Dan offered the VM with the following goals in mind :
	        <ul>
		        <li>Basic platform for learning about VMs</li>
		        <li>Boostrap and runtime framework for our eventual 'production' VM</li>
		        <li>Help spur architectural discussion about core
		            component designs</li>
