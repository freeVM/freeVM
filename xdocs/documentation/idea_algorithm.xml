      <p>
        The Bouncy Castle Crypto API jar, <tt>bcprov.jar</tt>,
        contains an implementation of the patented IDEA algorithm.
        For details of the restrictions on this algorithm,
        see <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/docs1.4/org/bouncycastle/crypto/engines/IDEAEngine.html">the
        Bouncy Castle documentation</a>.  Harmony contains a version
        of the <tt>bcprov.jar</tt> with the algorithm removed.  The
        original jar file can be obtained from
        <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html">the
        Bouncy Castle release page</a>.
