<section name="Building and Deploying the Apache Harmony Website">

<subsection name="Building">
	<p>
		The following tools are required to build the Harmony website:
		
		<ul>
		    <li>
		      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
		    </li>
			<li>
			   Java 1.4.2 JDK
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	

		<ol>
			<li>
			   Download the website source from Harmony subversion repository:</li>
			   <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/harmony/standard/site</pre>
		
			
			<li>
			   Change into the site directory:
     <pre>$ cd site</pre> </li>
      <li>Run the default ant script target:</li>
			 <pre>$ ant</pre>
			
	    </ol>

	
	<p>
	  At this point, you have a complete generated website and documentation in the 
    <code>site/docs</code> subdirectory. Open the <code>index.html</code> page and start browsing.
	</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Making Changes">

  <p>
    Making changes is straightforward.  All edits are made to the contents of the <code>xdocs/</code> 
    subdirectory, and then rendered via the procedure above into the <code>docs/</code> directory.
  
</p>
  
  <p>
    If you are a Harmony committer, you can simply checkin your changes. If you are not 
    a committer, any updates and additions to the site are very welcome. Please
    see our <a href="../get-involved.html">Get Involved</a> page for instructions
    on how to contribute your changes.
  </p>
  
</subsection>

<subsection name="Deploying to Harmony Website">

  <p>
    If you are a Harmony Committer, you can commit your changes into SVN and then
    publish to the project website. Once the changes are in SVN, do the following:
  </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        SSH to <code>minotaur.apache.org</code>. Your login name will of course be your own.</li>
        <pre>$ ssh geirm@minotaur.apache.org </pre>
        
      <li>
        Go to the project website directory:</li>
        <pre>$ cd /www/harmony.apache.org/</pre>
      
      <li>
        Update the local copy in one of two ways:
        <pre>$ svn update</pre>
        If you need to delete the HTML and 
        re-checkout, use: 
        <pre>$ `cat UPDATE`</pre></li>
        <p class="note">Note</p>
        <p class="notetext">The <code>UPDATE</code> file has the command performing a fresh svn checkout.</p> 
     
        
    </ol>
