<section name="Building and Deploying the Apache Harmony Website">

<subsection name="Building">
	<p>
		The following tools are required to build the Harmony website
		
		<ul>
		    <li>
		      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
		    </li>
			<li>
			   Java 1.4.2 JDK
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			   Download the website source from Harmony subversion repository
			   <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/harmony/standard/site</pre>
			</li>
			
			<li>
			   Change into the site directory and run the default ant script target
			  <pre>$ cd site</pre>
			  <pre>$ ant</pre>
			</li>
	    </ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  At this point, you have a complete generated website and documentation in the <i>site/docs</i>
	   subdirectory.  Open the <i>index.html</i> page and start browsing.
	</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Making Changes">

  <p>
    Making changes is straightforward.  All edits are made to the contents of the <i>xdocs/</i> 
    subdirectory, and then rendered via the procedure above into the <i>docs/</i> directory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are a Harmony committer, you can simply checkin your changes.  If you are not 
    a committer, any updates and additions to the site are very welcome.  Please
    see our <a href="../get-involved.html">Get Involved</a> page for instructions
    on how to contribute your changes.
  </p>

<subsection name="Deploying to Harmony Website">

  <p>
    If you are a Harmony Committer, you can commit your changes into SVN and then
    publish to the project website.  Once the changes are in SVN, simply :
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        SSH to minotaur.apache.org
        <pre>$ ssh geirm@minotaur.apache.org </pre>
        Your login name will of course be your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the project website directory.
        <pre>$ cd /www/incubator.apache.org/harmony/</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Update the local copy.  There are two ways.  A simple
        <pre>$ svn update</pre>
        will update the local copy.  If you need to delete the HTML and 
        re-checout use 
        <pre>$ `cat UPDATE`</pre>
        as the UPDATE file has the command used to do a fresh svn checkout.
      </li>
        
    </ol>
