<section name="Building the Apache Harmony Class Library">
	<p>
		The Harmony class library code is a subset of the Java(tm) SE 1.4.2 APIs currently
		being developed in the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/harmony/">
		Apache Harmony project</a>. This page describes how to build the class library code,
		and includes links to pre-built versions of the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Standard Disclaimer:</i>
		Apache Harmony is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
		Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until
		a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
		decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
		successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
		reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate
		that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF. 
	</p>

<subsection name="Building from source">
	<p>
		The Harmony class library code is available for Microsoft(tm) Windows(tm) and
		Linux(tm) operating systems, on x86 processors only.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following prerequisite tools must be available on the path in order to build
		the Harmony classlib code from source.
		<ul>
			<li>All platforms require Subversion client, Apache Ant, Java 1.4.2 JDK
				(i.e. including javac) in addition
				<ul>
	    			<li>Windows platforms : Microsoft Visual C++, and nmake. </li>
	    			<li>Linux platforms : Gnu gcc.</li>
	    		</ul>
		    </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can build the latest version of the class library code in three simple steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Download classlib source from Harmony subversion repository
			<pre>svn checkout -r HEAD https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/harmony/enhanced/classlib/trunk Harmony</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Change to main make directory, and run the default ant script target
			<pre>cd Harmony/make
ant</pre>
			</li>
			<li><a href="#Obtaining_a_VM">Get a VM suitable for running the class library
				code</a>, and
				expand it over the top of the Harmony directory (so that the 'jre'
				directories line-up)
			<pre>unzip &lt;path_to_vm_zip&gt; -d ../.. (on Windows)</pre>
			<pre>tar xzf &lt;path_to_vm_tarball&gt; --directory ../.. (on Linux)</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you are ready to <a href="#Running_Java">run some Java applications</a>!
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Using pre-built binaries">
	<p>
		Pre-built binaries are available as a convenience for people who don't
		have ready access to the prerequisite tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are <i>snapshot</i> builds, not official releases of the project.
		Snapshots are builds of the repository at a given revision.  The file
		name of each snapshot build indicates the revision of the code repository,
		and the platform on which it was built.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use a pre-built binaries in three easy steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain a pre-built class library snapshot for your platform from the
				<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/dist/incubator/harmony/snapshots/">
				Harmony snapshot site</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="#Obtaining_a_VM">Obtain a compatible virtual machine</a> and
				put it into the same directory as the class library code.</li>
   			<li>Simply expand the classlib archive and the VM archive from the
   				same directory. They should create a subdirectory called &quot;Harmony&quot;
   				with files from each archive overlaid (so that the
   				'Harmony/deploy/jre'-s line-up).</li>
   				On Windows:
   				<pre>unzip &lt;path_to_classlib_zip&gt; (on Windows)
unzip &lt;path_to_vm_zip&gt;</pre>
				On Linux:
				<pre>tar xzf &lt;path_to_classlib_tarball&gt; (on Linux)
tar xzf &lt;path_to_vm_tarball&gt;</pre>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you are ready to <a href="#Running_Java">run some Java applications</a>!
	</p>
</subsection>


<subsection name="Obtaining a compatible VM">
<a name="Obtaining_a_VM"/>
	<p>
		The Harmony class library code interfaces to a VM through a virtual machine interface
		defined in the Harmony project.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a VM that implements this interface available from the
		<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony/index.html">
		IBM DeveloperWorks site</a>.
		<em>The IBM VM is not open source</em> (although the VM interface itself is).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have obtained the IBM VM you should have one of the following files:
		<ul>
			<li>on Windows &quot;Harmony-vme-win.IA32-v1.zip&quot;</li>
			<li>on Linux &quot;Harmony-vme-linux.IA32-v1.tar.gz&quot;</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Running Java applications">
<a name="Running_Java"/>
	<p>
		Run Java applications as usual, using the launcher in Harmony/deploy/jre/bin:
		<pre>> jre\bin\java -showversion -jar helloworld.jar
java version 1.4.2 (subset)
