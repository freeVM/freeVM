    <section name="Getting Started For Users">
    <p style="text-align: right"><a href="quickhelp_users.ru.html">RU</a> | EN</p>
        <p>
          The current document provides basic instructions for people that
          wish to use Apache Harmony for running their Java programs. The
          steps described below neither require development tools nor
          necessitate compiling source code.
        </p>
    <p>
      For more information on how to get you machine configured to build and
      work with the Apache Harmony source code, refer to 
      <a href="quickhelp_contributors.html">
        Getting Started For Contributors</a>.
    </p>
        <p>
            The required dependencies are listed below per platform.
        </p>

    <subsection name="Download the Apache Harmony Snapshot">

        <p>
            First, download the binary distribution appropriate to
            your platform. We currently distribute binaries for Linux and 
            Microsoft Windows. Please follow the instructions on the 
            <a href="download.cgi">download page</a>
            to choose and download the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the Apache Harmony project has no formal releases of 
            its software.
            Instead, the project offers pre-built snapshots that
            are expected to run well on the platforms offered.
        </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Unpack the Binary Distribution">

        <p>
            Once you have obtained the appropriate binary distribution,
            you need to unpack it on your machine. In all cases, the
            distribution will unpack into a <code>jre</code>
            directory. Further in the document we refer to this directory
            as the <i>root directory</i> of the distribution.
        </p>
<dl>
        <dt>Linux Users</dt>

        <dd>
           Use the <code>tar</code> program as follows:
<pre>$ tar -tzf latest-harmony-jre-linux.tar.gz</pre>
</dd>
        <dd>
            This will unpack the JRE directory tree into the current directory.
        </dd>
        <dt>Windows Users</dt>
        <dd>
          Use one of <code>zip</code> utilities available for Windows to
          unpack the distribution. The three popular ones are listed
          below, but anything that can handle a <code>zip</code> file
          will work:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">Info-ZIP</a>
                (open source software)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> (free software)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.winzip.com/">Winzip</a> (commercial)</li>
        </ul></dd>
        <dd>
            To create the JRE directory tree, extract the
            distribution <code>zip</code> file using the utility.
        </dd></dl>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Configuring Your Environment">
        <p>
            Apache Harmony requires no further environmental setup, but
            sometimes other programs do. Also, it is convenient to have
            the Apache Harmony executables on your path.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and <code>PATH</code>
          environment variables, use the commands appropriate to your
          operating system and/or shell you are using.
        </p>
<dl>
        <dt>
          Linux Users</dt>
        <dd>
            The following command works for the Bash shell:
<pre>$ cd jre
$ export JAVA_HOME=`pwd`
$ cd bin
$ export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH</pre>
</dd>
        <dd>
            The given command assumes your current directory is the parent
            directory of the Harmony JRE.
        </dd>
      <p class="note">Note</p>
      <p class="notetext">The <code>`</code> character is a backtick character,
      not an apostrophe.</p>
       <dt>Windows Users</dt>
        <dd>
            The following example assumes you unpacked the <code>zip</code> 
            file into the root directory <code>C:\</code>.
            Please adjust as necessary.
<pre>
C:\&gt; set JAVA_HOME=C:\jre
C:\&gt; set PATH=C:\jre\bin;%PATH%
</pre>
</dd>
      </dl>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Using Apache Harmony">
        <p>
            After performing aforementioned steps, you should be ready to use
            Apache Harmony. Try running your Java application:
        </p>
<pre>$ java Foo
$ java -jar myjar.jar</pre>
      <p>In addition to standard options, you can use custom 
      <a href="cmd_options.html">command-line options</a>
      to adjust operation of the VM.</p>
