      <p>
        Our project goal is an open source, compatible implementation of Java SE 5.
        It's a major task being done by a community of volunteers.  Thus, the following
        is an approximate roadmap for what the project hopes to achieve in the next year.

        <h3>1. JDK tools</h3>

        <p>
          As part of the JDK that Harmony will distribute, we'll include
          the full set of tools that Java programmers expect to find in
          any JDK.  For maximum portablility, we plan to write all of the
          tools in Java, using the Harmony launcher as the portable native
          code that starts the VM and invokes the tool.  Currently, we have
          javac completed via the Eclipse compiler, but we need the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            javac (Done), javadoc, apt, appletviewer, jar, jdb, javah, javap, extcheck
          </li>
          <li>
            keytool, jarsigner, policytool, kinit, klist, ktab
          </li>
          <li>
            native2ascii,rmic, rmiregistry, rmid, serialver
          </li>
          <li>
            tnameserv, idlj, orbd, servertool
          </li>
          <li>
            pack200, unpack200
          </li>
          <li>
            htmlconverter, javaws
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Again, we have the portable launcher framework - we just need volunteers.
        </p>


        <h3>2. Modularity</h3>
        <p>
          From the beginning of our project, we've had a strong interest and focus
          on modularity  This dedication has paid off in our class library development,
          as we've been able to evaluate competing implementations of RMI and math, as
          well as allow developers to isolate development on one module.
        </p>

        <p>
          The modularity story for the class library is reasonable complete at this
          point, as we have completed the modularization of the native code as well.
          However, there is plenty of work to be done with our virtual machines - the
          goal being able to define a set of standard interfaces to which modular
          VM components can be written.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Build Engineering">

        <p>
          Build engineering in Harmony is a complicated subject, as we are building
          on multiple platforms in multiple languages.  So far, we have support for
          our Windows and Linux ports, but our porting plans indiciate that we'll need
          to revisit given the differnet toolchains.  There are many things to do
          in this area, many not listed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, the project has been releasing snapshots of our class library,
          but now that we have the DRLVM virtual machine, we can start doing complete
          snapshot builds of a JRE, as well as the HDK
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Switch to use system libraries, dynamically where appropriate
            - libz, libpng, libjpeg, liblcms, libicu*, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create regular schedule for snapshots and automate.
            Maybe every two weeks for now?
            <ol>
              <li>HDK - libraries, jars, headers</li>
              <li>JDK - tools + JRE</li>
              <li>JRE = classlib + DRLVM</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Federated build - abliity to builds a complete JDK from top level
            using choice of project VM
          </li>
          <li>
            Agreement between project parts (DRLVM, classlib) on things like
            debug/release flag, structure of artifacts (model after classlib for now)
          </li>
          <li>
            Common dependency pool for all projet parts to share
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch DRLVM build to a class library-like ant + make configuration
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove assumption in class library build system that all that uses make is
            linux.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Build-Test Framework">
        <p>
          The goal of this part of the Harmony project, the build-test framework,
          is make it easy for anyone to setup the CI infrastructure for the
          project and submit automated reports on building and testing of the
          project codebase on that platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/harmony/enhanced/buildtest/">
            initial implementation
          </a> in place in SVN, but much more work is needed.
          Ideas include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Send mail to project on success/fail transition
          </li>
          <li>
            Create live "status dashboard" with a summary of results from all tested platforms,
            as wella s history for each tested platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrate with <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/~stuart/japi/">JAPI</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrate with <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/mauve/">Mauve</a> for further
            class library testing
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrate with test-coverage tool (ex <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">emma</a>
            for auto-generated reports.
          </li>
          <li>
            Externalize local properties into a 'test.properties' file for easy of localization.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Performance, Stability and Reliability">

        <p>
          Our goal is a high-performance, stable and compatible implementation of Java SE 5.
          While passing the TCK is a measure of compatibility with the standard,
          performance and stability is something that must be achieved independently.
          We are looking to:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Define a set of stress, stability and performance tests that are
            freely available and easy to automate in our

          </li>
          <li>
            Measure and monitor baseline peformance using these tests
            with our standard builds across our supported platform matrix.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify and fix stability and performance problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Class Library">

        <p>
          The  class library is an important (and large!) part of the Java SE
          platform.  While we have made significant progress so far (~80% at last
          check), there are many, many interesting things remaining to be done
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="subcomponents/classlibrary/status.html">General package completion</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            java.util.concurrency: integration of Doug Lea's RI package.  Goal is to
            use unmodified code from the 166 expert group and implent whatever
            support is needed by the VM and rest of class library. (in progress)
          </li>
          <li>
            CORBA: re-use the Apache Yoko project (currently in incubator)
            as the required implementation of CORBA nad related support
            classes (in progress)
          </li>
          <li>
            JMX: currently we have the standard MX4J jars integrated, but
            looking to see what kind of collaboration or unification we can
            achieve with the MX4J project. (in progress)
          </li>
          <li>
            Test coverage - we need to greatly increase our unit tests (functionaly,
            spec, implementation)

          As we now have a fairly usable class library and virtual machine, we wish to
          make it easy for the broad Java user community to help us ensure that
          the Harmony class library supports the classes necessary for the most popular
          and used applications out there.  While we will complete the class library,
          tools like this will help us do it in a way that prioritizes the most useful
          first, enabling even more users to test our software and participate in
          the project.  So far, there have been a few tools donated, but no concerted
          effort to package for ease of use.
