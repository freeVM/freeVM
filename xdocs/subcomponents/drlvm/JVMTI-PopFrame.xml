      <section name="JVMTI Pop Frame">
         <p>
            Here is a description of how popping a frame is currently
            implemented in the DRLVM tool interface (JVMTI). For a
            definition of the pop frame functionality, consult the JVMTI
            specification [<a href="#JVMTISpec">1</a>]. For generic
            information on JVMTI in the DRL virtual machine and for definition
            of related terms, see the <a href="developers_guide.html" title="DRLVM Developer's Guide">developer's
            guide</a>.
         </p>

         <subsection name="Introduction">
         <p> Popping a stack frame becomes necessary when execution is in a native
           function and a <a href="developers_guide.html#M2nFrame">managed-to-native
           frame</a> (M2nFrame) is on the stack. This means that the JVMTI 
       component pops the M2nFrame and the Java frame above it. A frame is popped
           each time the JVMTI function <code>PopFrame()</code> is
       called. The current pop-frame implementation is based on the exception
       handling mechanism for transferring execution control. This way, VM pops
       frames on the current thread only. To pop frames on other threads, VM
       uses the M2nFrame flag system and callbacks.</p>
          </subsection>
         <subsection name="How to Pop a Frame">
         <p>To pop a frame on the current thread, refer to the following core
            functions:
         </p>
         <table>
            <tr>
               <th class="TableHeading">

                     Transfers control to the previous frame. This function is
                     a simple and fast combination of sequential calls of
                     <code>jvmti_jit_prepare_pop_frame</code> and
                     <code>jvmti_jit_complete_pop_frame</code>.

                <td class="TableCell">

                     unpredictable and unexpected. JVMTI cannot work in this
                     state and waits until the popped frame is resumed and the
                     frame state is changed.

                <td class="TableCell">
                     The frame is popped now but VM state is OK and JVMTI can

            </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
            In the current implementation, popping a frame goes in the
            following way:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               VM suspends the popped thread in one of these functions:
               <code>thread_suspend_disable()</code> or in <code>hythread_safe_point()</code>.
            </li>
           <li>
             The JVMTI Agent calls <code>PopFrame()</code> and does the following:
             <ol>
               <li>
                 Checks that the flag for the topmost M2nFrame is set to <code>FRAME_POPABLE</code>,
                 which means that the frame can be popped.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Changes the flag
                 to <code>FRAME_POP_NOW</code>.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Sets the safe point for the callback function. The suspended thread
                 executes the callback while staying in the function where the
                 thread is suspended.
               </li>
             </ol>
           </li>
           <li>
             The callback
             function pops the frame in one of the following ways depending on
             the function and on area of the stack:
             <ol>
               <li>
                 For <b>hythread_safe_point():</b>
                 <ol>
                   <li>
                     VM finds the register
                     context for the previous frame and saves it in the current M2nFrame.
                     The frame type flag changed to <code>FRAME_POP_DONE</code>.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     VM exits the safe point and checks the frame status. If
                     the frame is popped, VM transfers control to the saved register
                     context. Otherwise, VM exits normally.
                   </li>
                 </ol>
               </li>
               <li>
                 For the <b>suspend_disable()</b> function in an <a href="developers_guide.html#Exception_Handling">
                   unwindable
                   area of the stack
                 </a>:
                 <ol>
                   <li>
                     The callback explicitly calls <code>hythread_safe_point()</code> to
                     stop the current thread in the safe point and wait until
                     the thread is resumed by another thread.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     When the thread is resumed, the callback pops the frame
                     for the current thread and transfers control to the previous
                     frame.
                   </li>
                 </ol>
               </li>
               <li>
                 For the <strong>suspend_disable()</strong> function in a <a href="developers_guide.html#Exception_Handling">
                   non-unwindable
                   area of the stack
                 </a>:
                 <ol>
                   <li>
                     VM raises a special exception object and waits for the end
                     of the area.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                     After exiting the area, VM checks whether the exception
                     is set and pops the frame for the current thread and transfers
                     control to the previous frame.
                   </li>
                 </ol>
               </li>
              </ol>
           </li>
         </ol>
         </subsection>
         <subsection name="Implementation Specifics">
        

         <ul>
           <li>Because the implementation re-uses the exception scheme, popping
              a frame does not transfer control to the beginning of the bytecode
        invoke instruction, but to the native call instruction. This is possible
             because the JIT compiles an invoke instruction into
              several native instructions including the call.<br />
              A better way of handling the operation is to make VM transfer
              control to the beginning of the invoke instruction block. </li>
           <li> In the exception handling mechanism, control is returned to the
               instruction pointer (IP) after the call instruction. This way, VM
                must find the call IP of the previous instruction by using
                information on JIT calling conventions.<br />
It is advisory to move the corresponding functionality to JIT so that VM has no data
on JIT calling conventions. </li>
           <li> Object references in popped frames can become outdated during
                garbage collection because VM components do not enumerate the stack
                for such frames. For GC purposes, JVM TI enumerates popped frames
                until the thread is resumed and control is transferred. </li>
           <li> Due to specifics of the current thread manager implementation,
                the pop frame cannot guarantee synchronization of thread-suspend
                states across different threads. This way, if Thread A suspends
                Thread B, the current implementation cannot guarantee that Thread
             B is not resumed by another thread. In such a situation, operation of
                Thread A can be unstable because it relies on Thread B being
                suspended. </li>
         </ul>
