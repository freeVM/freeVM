<section name="DRLVM">
    <p> 
    DRLVM stands for Dynamic Runtime Layer Virtual Machine, a clean-room implementation of the J2SE 1.5.0
        virtual machine.
    </p>
    <p>
    Key goals of DRL include the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Modularity:</em> Functionality is grouped into a limited number of 
        coarse-grained modules with well defined interfaces. </li>
        <li><em>Pluggability:</em> Module implementations can be replaced at compile time or run time. 
        Multiple implementations of a given module are possible. </li>
        <li><em>Consistency:</em> Interfaces are consistent across platforms. </li>
        <li><em>Performance:</em> Interfaces fully enable implementation of modules optimized for specific target platforms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following documentation links are specific to the DRLVM virtual machine
        effort underway at Apache Harmony.
