         Crash and signals handler in Apache Harmony
      </title>
   </head>


<body>
<h1>Crash and signals handler in Apache Harmony</h1>
<p>Apache Harmony Crash and signals handler (CH) is used for a platform-independent
handling of runtime errors and exceptions in a program. CH may be used as a portable
signal abstraction layer, but its main purpose is to provide a facility for
post mortem analysis of managed runtime applications that use just-in-time
compilers (JITs) to generate user application
executable code. This makes crash handling library of Apache Harmony unique
among other facilities because they cannot analyze the native stack of compiled
code. An application that does not utilize runtime compilers can use this
library as well, such an application would provide no information
about compiled methods to crash handler and therefore it would analyze only its
native code.</p>
<h2>1.  Terminology</h2>
<p><i>CH</i> &ndash; acronym used to identify the component crash and <i>signals</i> handling of Apache Harmony.</p>
<p><i>Signal</i> &ndash; an event delivered by the operating system to an application under
certain conditions. Signal is a name traditionally used on UNIX systems. On
Windows* OS, such events are called exceptions. In this document, the term <i>signal</i> is used to define both signal and
exception depending on the target platform, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<h2>2.  How the crash handler works</h2>
<p>Upon its initialization, the crash handler library registers to receive a
big number of signals (exceptions on Windows), all of which are usually considered
fatal for most applications. CH allows the application to make a decision
whether the crash sequence should be started when a signal is delivered to the
application. To filter such events, the application can register callbacks for
each signal type that it is interested in, so the execution flow follows one of
these paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>
If a
callback returns a non-zero value, the signal is considered handled and the
application does not crash. Instead, CH transfers execution control to the
register context that the application may update in order not to receive the
signal again.
</li><li>
If a callback
returns zero, the signal is considered fatal, and a crash sequence is started. </li>
</ol>
<p>CH
outputs information about the location of the crash based on the crash
information flags that the application set. These flags control the amount of
information that CH prints. In addition, the application may specify its own
callbacks to dump some application specific information, e.g. its data tables.</p>
<p>The following sequence describes signal handling in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>
An
operating system delivers a signal to the application. The signal is handled by
the crash handler's registered signal handler.</li>
<li>
CH exits
the signal handler context, because the OS signal handler context may be unsafe
for performing certain operations, such as synchronization. To exit the
context, CH:
<ol> 
<li>Modifies the system-specific register context.</li>
<li>Saves the original register context at the position pointed by stack pointer register
from the crash register context for future use.</li>
<li> Exits the signal handler. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>CH checks
whether the application has registered a callback for the type of the received
signal. Callbacks must be thread-safe, because signals may occur simultaneously
in different threads.
<ol>
<li>  
If the signal type has no registered callback, CH considers the signal fatal and initiates
the crash sequence. </li>
<li>
If the signal type has a registered callback, CH calls the callback to determine
whether such signal is fatal for the application.
<ol><li>
If the application
handles the signal, CH transfers execution control to the registers that
application specified in its callback.</li>
<li> If the application
doesn't handle the signal, CH considers the signal fatal and initiates the crash
sequence.</li>
</ol></li></ol></li>
<li>
CH locks a
global synchronization lock, so that no other crashes can be processed. If the application
crashes in a different thread, that crash is ignored.</li>
<li>
CH goes
through the list of flags and outputs the information about the crashed
application based on their values. The application may change these flags at
any moment; e.g. if some types of signals require a special type of output.
When CH prints the stack trace for the crash point, it may use the function
specified by the application to iterate over the compiled code. See section 3.2
for its description.</li>
<li>
After all
information is dumped, CH calls application crash callbacks one by one.
Different application components may register their crash actions to dump their
specific data. If a crash happens while dumping such tables, the next
application crash callback is called (this functionality is in development). Because
these kinds of callbacks are called in a synchronized region, they don't have
to be thread-safe.</li>
<li>
CH unregisters signal handlers previously registered to define
default OS specific action depending on the signal that was received by the
application.</li>
<li>
CH
transfers control to the original register's context. If the application
previously set the CH flag to call the debugger, CH unlocks the global crash
lock and calls the platform-specific debugger for analyzing the crash at the
point where the original signal occurred. If some other threads also crashed
and are waiting on the crash handler lock, the behavior depends on OS
processing for multiple crashes in different threads.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.  Using crash and signals handler from an
application</h2>
<p>The crash handler API is defined in port_crash_handler.h
and port_frame_info.h header files. The API consists
of 2 parts, initialization and output management.</p>
<h3>3.1    
Initialization</h3>
<p>Initialization is the main part of the CH library. It is done with a
function port_init_crash_handler(). To process
signals in a specific way, the application must supply an array of signal
handling callbacks (see section 2) and a pointer to the stack iteration
function, which performs lookup through compiled methods and returns method
names and other relevant information (see section 3.2 for details).</p>
<h3>3.2    
Stack
iteration callback</h3>
<p>To iterate over compiled methods, CH uses the application defined
function. It has quite complicated semantics, for exact specification see port_frame_info.h header file.</p>
<p>When a signal is considered fatal, CH prints the execution stack for the
crashed thread. For that, CH identifies methods in the stack via the IP
register and finds out whether the crash happened in a compiled method using
stack iteration callback in the following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>
CH
initializes port_stack_frame_info with zeroes and
calls stack iteration callback.</li>
<li>
If stack
iteration callback returns non-zero value, it means that it requires some
internal state to be allocated in port_stack_frame_info
structure. CH allocates a buffer of requested size, initializes it with zeroes
and continues.
<ol>
<li>a.  
If stack
iteration returns zero, it means that it knows method pointed to by IP in
register context, and it filled up information about it in port_stack_frame_info.
Fields that were filled up by stack iteration callback are printed by CH.
<br/>Optionally when stack iteration callback returns zero, it updates
register context and internal stack iteration information in port_stack_frame_info to point to a previous method in the
stack. This functionality necessary if application needs to
display a continuous stack of compiled method.</li>
<li>
If stack iteration
callback returns -1 it means that register context points to a method not known
by the application as compiled. In this case CH switches to iteration through
native code using its platform depending heuristics. In any case, the
application can return information about the current frame in the port_stack_frame_info structure. If some zeroed fields of
the structure are filled by the application, they are displayed in the stack
dump.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
CH goes
back to step 2 until it reaches the condition that stack iteration callback
returned -1 and native unwinding heuristics is unable to unwind the stack
further (see section 4.2).</li></ol>
<h3>3.3    
Output
management</h3>
<p>CH has a set of flags that control its output in case of a crash. The application
may specify its own mode of output using the port_crash_handler_set_flags() function. These
flags may be changed at any time to adjust the output of information depending
on the crash that happened. For example, for a failed assertion it is probably
not necessary to print a register context because it gives no useful
information.</p>
<p>Additionally, CH allows the application to dump additional information
in case of a crash. The application may add multiple callbacks using the port_crash_handler_add_action() function. Each application component may then dump its
internal data separately.</p>
<h3>3.4    
Shutdown</h3>
<p>When the application shuts down, it may unregister
CH so that all signal handlers are assigned their default values. This option
is useful at the late stages of shutdown when the application cannot handle
crashes and output any application-specific data (e.g. all tables are already
de-allocated). To unregister the crash handler,
application may use the port_shutdown_crash_handler()
function.</p>
<h2>4.  Implementation notes</h2>
<p>The crash handler has some design decisions that may affect its usage in
specific scenarios. This section describes them.</p>
<h3>4.1    
Stack
overflow handling</h3>
<p>Application callbacks for the signals are called when the OS signal
handler has already exited. When CH starts processing the signal, some signal
information needed is already lost. Because storing this information for every
received signal may reduce the application performance, in case of a crash, CH
sets thread-local indicators and continues execution in the original register
context to catch the same signal again and perform required crash processing
inside the OS signal handler. This technique does not work for the stack
overflow exception on Windows, because access to the protected memory region which
caused the signal is restored automatically in OS signal delivery. The problem
affects creating minidumps on Windows and displaying a message box for calling
a debugger. This limitation can disappear together with fixing <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-5617">HARMONY-5617</a>.</p>
<h3>4.2    
Compiled
and native stack</h3>
<p>In the previous CH implementation, stack iteration was based on the
compiled stack. Even if native stack unwinding was not done, stack iteration
continued and printed the whole compiled stack even with no native stack
information; the whole compiled stack was printed with or without native stack
information. In the current CH implementation, native stack unwinding takes a
lead in stack iteration. When the current frame cannot be unwound with the application
callback and the native stack unwinding algorithm, the iteration stops, even if
more compiled frames are present.</p>
<h3>4.3    
Creating
core dumps on Linux</h3>
<p>Core dump is created on Linux when the default signal handler is called
for some signals. When application requests to call the debugger in case of a crash,
the application does not actually crash, but continues execution as a debugged
application. Therefore, when the debugger is called on Linux, core dump is not
generated.</p>
<h3>4.4    
Working
with libraries</h3>
<p>The Harmony Crash Handler is mostly designed as a crash handler for a
standalone application. There may be problems using it with libraries linked to
another application, which may have its own signal handling routines.</p>
<h3>4.5    
Windows
compatibility</h3>
<p>On Windows, CH uses VEH (Vectored Exception Handler) for centralized signals
catching. This functionality is unavailable on Windows versions earlier than
Windows XP/Windows Server 2003, so CH cannot be used on Windows 2000 and
earlier.</p>
