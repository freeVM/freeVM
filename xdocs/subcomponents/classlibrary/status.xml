            <p>
                Stuart Ballard of the Kaffe project is generously creating automated coverage comparisons
                of
                <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/~stuart/japi/htmlout/h-jdk15-harmony.html">JDK 1.5</a>
                and
                <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/~stuart/japi/htmlout/h-jdk6-harmony.html">JDK 1.6</a>
                against the
                <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/harmony/snapshots/">Harmony class library snapshots.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The comparisons above is measuring compatibility with RI's
              implementation. There is a number of
              <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/index.html">endorsed packages</a>
              for which it is allowed to implement a later version of theirs specification.
              In case of newer specification it is acceptable to have difference with RI (for
              example, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/yoko.html">CORBA implementation</a>).
              To measure Harmony API completeness (i.e. differences that have to be
              fixed) the reports without endorsed packages are provided. See:
              <a href="http://people.apache.org/~apetrenko/japitool/jdk5vsharmony5.javajavax.html">RI vs Harmony M1</a>
              and 
              <a href="http://people.apache.org/~apetrenko/japitool/harmony5vsjdk5.javajavax.html">Harmony M1 vs RI</a>
