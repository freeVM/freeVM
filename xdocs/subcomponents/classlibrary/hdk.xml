<section name="Harmony Development Kit for the Apache Harmony Class Library">
	<p>
		The Harmony Development Kit (HDK) allows a Harmony developer to 
		rebuild	any module of the Harmony Classlib in a standalone way by providing all the 
		necesary supplementary binaries and header files. This document describes the layout 
		of such an HDK and its contents.
	</p>

<subsection name="Layout of the HDK">
	<p>
		An HDK contains all the header files and binaries, both native and Java, required
		for a Harmony classlib developer to build against. The directory structure for an
		HDK is as follows:
		<blockquote>
		<pre>
&lt;hdkbase&gt;
     |---jdk
     |    |---jre
     |    |
     |    \---include
     |
     |---include
     |
     \---lib
		</pre>
		</blockquote>
		
		The directories laid out above are used in the following manner:
		
		<ul>
			<li><code>&lt;hdkbase&gt;/jdk/jre</code> - this directory contains the standard
			jre layout, including <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directories.
			</li>
			
			<li><code>&lt;hdkbase&gt;/jdk/include</code> - this directory contains the standard
			jdk header files. For example, jni.h is held here.
			</li>
			
			<li><code>&lt;hdkbase&gt;/include</code> - this directory contains header files that
			are Harmony specific and are used across multiple classlib modules.
			</li>
			
			<li><code>&lt;hdkbase&gt;/lib</code> - this directory is used in HDKs on Windows for
			.lib files and on Linux for .a files necessary for linking during compilation of 
			classlib natives.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
