      This document is not complete. The final version will be finalized as
      the framework development is completed and associated feedback is recieved.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be part of the project and successfully contribute to it this
      is important to know about test and release process, automation
      for testing, available test suites and scenarios.
      So the main target of this document is to provide a developer with all
      required information. The information is divided into the next
      sections:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#Process">Harmony Test and Release Process</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Automation">Framework for Testing and Automation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Suites">Test Suites and Scenarios</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <section name="Harmony Test and Release Process">
    <a name="Process" />
    <p>
      A joint decision about a release schedule and acceptance criteria
      is made on
      <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/mailing.html">the Harmony mailing list</a>.
      Currently only
      <a href="http://harmony.apache.org/download.cgi#Stable">milestone builds</a>
      are released - the project has no official releases. Usually the
      milestone builds are released on 2-3 month schedule and named using
      the next scheme: <i>Apache Harmony 5.0M&lt;milestone number&gt;</i>.
      Before a release date there is 1 week feature freeze period and 1
      week code freeze period. During feature freeze new functionality,
      big changes and code redesign are forbidden; only bugs fixes and
      code tidy-up are allowed. During code freeze period only fixes for
      critical/blocker issues are committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Harmony team does its best to deliver well tested implementation.
      As the project’s code-base consists of big number of code-lines
      the testing became not a trivial task. So the clear testing process
      was established, <a href="#Automation">automation for testing</a>
      and several <a href="#Suites">test suites</a> were developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently the testing process consists of two testing cycles:
      <i>integrity testing</i> and <i>snapshot testing</i>.
      Both cycles are based on
      <a href="#Automation">build-test framework</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Integrity testing</i>
      cycle is aimed to verify that code base is buildable and runs selected
      number of suites to catch regressions early. The cycle works on debug
      build. The integrity testing cycle is triggered by a developer commit
      (i.e. when a code is updated in the source code repository).
      Results of testing are
      <a href="http://people.apache.org/~varlax/harmony-integrity">published</a>
      almost immediately<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Snapshot testing</i>
      cycle is aimed to provid tested binaries on regular basis.
      Based on integrity testing results (i.e. the build is not broken and
      most of tests are passing) a revision for the next snapshot is chosen.
      When the snapshot is build it is uploaded to the web site and that in
      turn triggers the testing cycle. For each build snapshot there
      is a page with
      <a href="http://people.apache.org/~mloenko/snapshot_testing/script/snapshots_summary.html">tests results summary</a>.
      The page is updated dynamically as soon as results are ready.

  <section name="Framework for Testing and Automation">
    <a name="Automation" />
    <p>
      The
      <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/harmony/enhanced/buildtest/trunk/infra">
      <i>build-test framework</i></a>
      is targeted to assist a developer with running different suites and
      automation of testing process. The framework is a set of ANT scripts 
      that provides necessary support to simplify installation, setup of
      Harmony build, <a href="#Suites">test suites</a> and configuring
      <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/"><code>CruiseControl</code></a>.
    </p>
    <subsection name="Prerequisites"> 
      <p> You need to obtain and install the same <a href="../../quickhelp_contributors.html">tools</a>, 
        as for building the Apache Harmony components.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Setup">
      <p> Get the infrastructure by checking it out from the project Subversion repository:</p>

      <pre>svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/buildtest/trunk/infra</pre>

      <p>
         With Java, Ant and SVN installed, change into the <code>infra</code>
         directory and type:
      </p>

      <pre>ant -Dtest.suites="&lt;<i>list of suites&gt;</i>" install</pre>

      <p>
        This command fetches external dependencies (including
        <code>CruiseControl</code>), checks out Harmony build and test suites
        (if necessary), sets up testing environment. After <code>install</code>
        is complete it may request to specify unset required properties
        for selected suites. The <code>required-parameters.properties</code>
        file contains a list of all required properties.
        If a property has empty or unresolved value
        then a property has to be set in <code>framework.local.properties</code>
        file and <code>install</code> target has to be re-run.
      </p>

      <p>
         The next step is to setup suites. (Note: the framework saves the list
         of installed suites so the parameter <code>-Dtest.suites=...</code>
         is not required any more) Just simply type:
      </p>

      <pre>ant setup</pre>

      <p>
        This command launches <code>setup</code> target for each installed suite.
      </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Run">
      <p>
        The suites' run can be launched in two ways: by the framework or by
        <code>CruiseControl</code> tool. If a single run is needed type:
      </p>
      <pre>ant run</pre>

      <p>
        The command launches <code>run</code> target for each installed suite.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case when a continuous build and test process is required type:
      </p>
      <pre>ant run-cc</pre>

      <p>
        The given command launches <code>CruiseControl</code> with the full test set. 
        To check status, point your browser to:

  <section name="Test Suites and Scenarios">
    <a name="Suites" />
    <p>
      The Harmony testing base can be divided into 2 main parts:
      <i>suites</i> and <i>scenarios</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>test suite</i> is a collection of quite
      simple/short test cases that is used to verify that the
      implementation follows specified behavior.
      The project has several own test suites as well uses 3rd party
      (external) test suites.
    </p>
    <p>
      An application <i>testing scenario</i> (or simply testing scenario)
      is a set of actions/operations that models typical application's
      usage/functioning.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Note</p>
    <p class="notetext">
      Most of suites/scenarios below can be run with and without build-test
      framework. Please consult a suite's documentation for details.
