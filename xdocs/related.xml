  <section name="Other Projects">

  <p>
      The following list is of other projects related to open source Java that you
      may find interesting.
  </p>

  <p>
  We believe that open source is valuable because of the communities behind the code - 
  and in the case of Apache Harmony, the the collaboration and interaction with
  these other projects brings additional
  health and diversity that go beyond a single project.
