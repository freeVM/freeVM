   <section name="Virtual Machines that Work with Harmony">
   
   <p>
   Besides our own DRLVM virtual machine, there are also other virtual
   machines that work with the Apache Harmony classlibrary : 
   </p>
   
   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony/">IBM J9</a> : IBM has
   made their production-grade virtual machine available for project use under
   a non-open source, evaluation binary license.  This VM works with the Harmony
   class library.
   </li>
   <li><a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/jrockit/jrockitVM/">BEA JRockit</a> : BEA has
   made their production-grade virtual machine available for project use under
   a non-open source, evaluation binary license.  This VM works with the Harmony
   class library.
   </li>
   </ul>

  <section name="Other Projects">

  <p>
      The following list is of other projects related to open source Java that you
      may find interesting.
  </p>

  <p>
  We believe that open source is valuable because of the communities behind the code - 
  and in the case of Apache Harmony, the the collaboration and interaction with
  these other projects brings additional
  health and diversity that go beyond a single project.

    <li><a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe JVM</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/classpath.html">GNU Classpath</a></li>
  </ul>
