<section name="How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?">

<p>
    The Apache Harmony project really needs and appreciates any contributions,
    including documentation help, source code and feedback. Suggested
    changes should come in the form of source code and/or very detailed
    and constructive feedback.

<section name="How to Create and Submit A Patch or Enhancement">

<p>
  One of the best ways to get involved in the Harmony project is to 
  create patches or additions and contribute them.  All contributions
  should be made via a new entry in our project 
  <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY">JIRA</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some basic guidelines and suggestions : 
  <ul>
  <li>
    Once you have completed your changes, please  be sure 
    to test your changes very well. 
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are offering a code addition or change, be sure that 
    the codebase builds cleanly and the full test suite passes 
    before submitting.  Patches that break the 
    build or break the code will be rejected.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you are offering a change to documentation or the website, 
    please review the generated output and be sure that it is as you expect.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are offering a fix to a bug, please provide a testcase and 
    instructions to help us duplicate the bug, and then test that the bug
    is fixed.  We will add the testcase to our testsuite.
  </li>
  <li>
     When offering something new, please include the entire file
     that you are contributing.
  </li>
  <li>
     When you are offering a change to something that already exists
     in the project SVN repository, please submit a patch as outlined below.
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Once you are sure you have tested/reviewed your changes, open a 
  new JIRA entry.  Clearly describe the patch or enhancement, and 
  provide details, such as how to re-create if a bug, why the 
  change or enhancement is useful, etc.  Then, attach all materials 
  to the JIRA entry via "Attach File".  Please be sure to select 
  "Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works...".  Any patch
  without this grant will be rejected.
</p>

<p>
  Please use the subversion 'diff' utility to create a patch as follows : 
  
  <pre>
    svn diff file.java > file.patch
  </pre>
  
  where 'file' is the filename that you have changed.  This will produce a 
  nice patch file that can be added to the JIRA, which makes it easy for
  the project committers to review and possibly accept your patch.
</p>
