<section name="How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?">

<p>
    The Apache Harmony project really needs and appreciates any contributions,
    including documentation help, source code and feedback. Suggested
    changes should come in the form of source code and/or very detailed
    and constructive feedback.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Discussion occurs on the <a
        href="mailing.html">Harmony mailing lists</a>

        Informal discussion also occurs on the
        <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/harmony">#harmony IRC channel</a>

<section name="Am I Eligible?">
    <p>
        You may have heard or read about Harmony's strict rules for contributor's
        eligibility. We take this seriously because a number of parties implement
        Java, and we respect their rights to their property. If you have detailed
        knowledge of another implementation of Java, and they have not explicitly
        approved your participation in Harmony, please check whether we will be able
        to accept your contribution by reading the
        <a href="contribution_policy.html">Apache Harmony contribution policy</a>.

<section name="How to Create and Submit A Patch or Enhancement">
<a name="create_patch"/>

  <p>
  One of the best ways to get involved in the Harmony project is to 
  create patches or additions and contribute them. When you propose 
  a specific change to the software for discussion or voting on the 
  mailing list, you should present in the form of input to the patch 
  command. 
  All contributions should be made via a new entry in our project 
  <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY">JIRA</a>.
</p>

  <subsection name="Change-offering Tips">
    <ul>

      <li>
        Once you have completed your changes, please be sure
        to test your changes very well. When changing the code base, 
        be sure that it builds cleanly and the full test suite passes
        before submitting. Patches that break the build or break the 
        code will be rejected.
      </li>
      <li>If you are offering...
        <ul>
           <li>
            A fix to a bug, please provide a test case and
            instructions to help us reproduce the bug, and then test that the bug
            is fixed. We will add the test case to our test suite.
          </li>
          <li>
            A change to documentation or the website,
            review the generated output and be sure that it is as you expect.
          </li>
          <li>
            New data, include the entire file that you are contributing.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are offering a change to something that already exists
        in the project SVN repository, submit a patch as outlined below.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <subsection name="Guidelines on how to Create and Submit a Patch">

    <p>
      Once you are sure you have tested/reviewed your changes, do the following:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a new <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY">
            JIRA entry</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Clearly describe the patch or enhancement, and
            provide details, such as how to re-create if a bug, why the
            change or enhancement is useful, etc.
      </li>
       <li>Use the Subversion&#174; <code>diff</code> utility to create a patch as follows:
<pre>svn diff file.java > file.patch</pre>
            where <code>file</code> is the filename that you have changed. This will produce a
          nice patch file that can be added to the <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY">
            JIRA</a>, which makes it easy for
            the project committers to review and possibly accept your patch.
           <br />
           <p class="example">Example</p>
<pre>diff -u http_main.c.orig http_main.c &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</pre>
           <p class="note">Note</p>
           <p class="notetext">The <code>diff</code> command only shows differences for
           text files, and not binary files. So even if you did <code>svn add</code> on
           a binary file (gif, jar, png etc.), it won't show up in the patch, and will fail
           to apply. The key string to look out for in the patch is:
<pre>Cannot display: file marked as a binary type. </pre></p>
              If you see that, you'll also need to attach the binary files that have changed
              separately to the issue. To get a list of such files in <code>file.patch</code>, run:
<pre>grep -B 2 "Cannot display" file.patch</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Attach all materials to the JIRA entry via <b>Attach File</b>.
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to select <b>Grant license to ASF for inclusion in ASF works...</b>.
            Any patch without this grant will be rejected.
        </li>
    </ul>
