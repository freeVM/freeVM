      <p>
        <strong>Basic Prerequisites</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The tools you must have to be able to work with Harmony are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> version 1.6.5 or higher
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="">Java SE 5 JDK</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Note</p>
      <p class="notetext">
        If you are working from behind a firewall, you may need to configure
        the proxy setting for <code>ant</code> and <code>svn</code> tools.<br />
        For the <code>ant</code> tool, set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment
        variable to point to: <code>
          <br />
          -Dhttp.proxyHost=&lt;host&gt;<br />
          -Dhttp.proxyPort=&lt;proxy&gt;
        </code><br />
        For the <code>svn</code> tool, follow the instructions appropriate to
        the version of the tool you use. For example, edit <code>~/.subversion/servers</code>
        file for console version of <code>svn</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Optional (but recommended) prerequisite is an Eclipse Java Compiler (ECJ), version 3.2 or higher. 
      You need to <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">download</a> 
      standalone ecj.jar and put it to <code>ANT_HOME/lib</code> directory.
      Alternatively, you can switch to any other Java 1.5 compiler supported by Ant
      via overriding <code>hy.javac.compiler</code> property.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other prerequisites for building Harmony differ by platform. For
        examples of platform-specific setup instructions, please see these
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/harmony/DevelopmentPlatformConfiguration">community maintained</a>
        descriptions. Below is a generic guideline for each platform. <br />

        <strong>Additional Prerequisites</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The build system requires additional software and libraries shared
        across different parts of the build or specific for individual build parts.
        The list is evolving, so the safest way to get and configure all the required software
        is to let the build download it from the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the list of additional tools required for one of the build parts, DRLVM.
        The list applies to Windows and Linux users.

      <p>
        You can download these resources prior to building DRLVM,
        unpack them, and specify the resulting locations by using the environment variables,
        as described in the
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/harmony/enhanced/drlvm/trunk/README.txt?view=co">
          README file
        </a>, step 3.3.1. In this file, you can find instructions
        on how to point to local versions instead of making the build download new ones from the net.
        <br /> Because the list of sotware is subject to change, we do <b>not</b> recommend
        that you download the software and not let the
        build do that for you.

    <subsection name="2. Checking out the Federated Build Tree">
      <p>
        The Harmony codebase is divided into many separate parts. To create
        a working JRE, you need a <i>class library</i> and a <i>virtual machine</i>. To
        obtain these tools, use the <i>federated build</i> tree and then work
        within the class library directory and the VM directory as you choose.
        Currently, the federated build uses the DRLVM virtual machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        To check out the federated build, use the following command:
      </p>

      <source>$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/trunk </source>

      <p>
        This command checks out a directory structure that
        contains <code>working_classlib</code> and <code>working_vm</code>
        directories. After you populate the source trees in the next step,
        <code>working_classlib</code>
        will be the checkout of the class library SVN tree
        and <code>working_vm</code> will be the checkout
        of the DRLVM SVN tree.
      </p>
      <p class="note">Note</p>
      <p class="notetext">
        If the root of the federated build is multiple levels deep in
        your file system, the very long paths within class library might
        result in a SVN checkout failure on Windows. The solution is to
        move the tree upwards in your file system or switch operating systems.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="3. Starting the Federated Build">
      <p>
        Now you should be ready to build the code. For the first time you build,
        you might want to fetch all the dependencies.
        If you do not, or if in the future a new dependency is added, the build will tell
        you what to do, so that you can do this step periodically. To fetch the
        dependencies and check out, build, and package snapshots of the JRE and HDK, type
        the following command in the root directory of the federated build:
      </p>
      <source>$ ant -Dauto.fetch=true</source>
      <p>
        This variant of command downloads all the required third-party components that can be
        distributed under licences different from the Apache license; see <code>THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt</code>
        in the root directory for details. This is only needed during your first build. For
        subsequent builds, just type:
      </p>
      <source>$ ant</source>
      <p class="note">Note</p>
      <p class="notetext">
        If you choose to build from the federated build root, you may need to
        increase the Java heap available to Ant.  We suggest setting the "ANT_OPTS" environment
        variable as ANT_OPTS='-Xms256m -Xmx512m' in the manner appropriate for your
        operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because running Ant in the root directory builds the full JDK, it can be inconvenient
        for a developer focused on a specific area. If you are not interested in building
        the full HDK, follow the <a href="#Detailed Building Instructions">detailed instructions</a>
        to build each JRE component separately.
      </p>
    </subsection>
  </section>
  <section name="Detailed Building Instructions">
    <p>If you do not need to build the whole HDK and did not execute <code>ant</code>
    in <a href="Running the Federated Build">step 3</a>, follow these instructions to
    build each component in turn and assemble the JRE from them. The building
    procedure consists of the following steps:</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <subsection name="1. Populating the Source Trees">
        <p>
          To populate the source trees, use the target located
          in the federated build <code>build.xml</code> script.
          Type the following command in the root directory of the
          federated build:
        </p>
        <source>$ ant populate_source</source>
        <p>
          The given command checks out class library and DRLVM into the
          <code>working_classlib</code> and <code>working_vm</code>
          directories respectively, <i>
            at the same SVN version of
            the <code>build.xml</code> file
          </i>.
          The source trees are large,
          therefore a checkout can take a very long time.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    <subsection name="2. Updating the Source Trees">
        <p>
          Any time going forward, you can bring any directory to current SVN
          revision simply by doing <code>svn update</code> in any directory.
        </p>

        <source>
$ cd working_classlib
$ svn update</source>

        <p>
          The aforementioned commands are valid checkouts of the class library
          and DRLVM. After executing <code>svn update</code>, your tree will
          reflect any modifications made to the SVN repository. If you are a
          project committer, you can make commits from within this tree, as it
          is a normal SVN checkout.
        </p>
        <p class="note">Note</p>
        <p class="notetext">
          If you fail to rebuild class library after the <code>svn update</code> command,
          clean previous build results:
        </p>
        <source>$ ant clean</source>

      </subsection>
    <subsection name="3. Building the Class Library">
      <p>
        Now you should be ready to build the code. First build
        the class library because DRLVM has a dependency on it and also
        assembles a working JRE as part of its build.
      </p>  
      <p>
          For the first time you build, you might want to fetch all the
          class library dependencies. If you do not, or if in the future a new
          dependency is added, the build will tell you what to do, so that you
          can do this step periodically. To fetch the class library dependencies
          and then build class library, use the following commands:
        </p>
        <source>
$ cd working_classlib
$ ant fetch-depends
$ ant</source>
        <p>
          You can only test the class libraries in case you have a virtual machine.
          If you do, run the following command to get the full test suite for the class library:
        </p>
        <source>$ ant test</source>
        <p>
          You can use a VM other than DRLVM, see
          <a href="#Combining JRE from Built Components">Combining JRE from Built Components</a>.
          If you want to
          use DRLVM, proceed with the instruction to build it.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    <subsection name="4. Building DRLVM">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Enter the build directory.</b><br />
            After building the class library, build DRLVM
            assembling a working JRE. For that, return
            to the root of the federated build and switch into the
            <code>working_vm</code> directory, then to the <code>build</code>
            directory:
            <pre>
$ cd working_vm/build</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Configure the environment.</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Edit <code>drlvm.properties</code>
                <p>
                  Tell the DRLVM build where to find the class library:
                  rename the file <code>drlvm.properties.example</code> in the DRLVM
                  <code>build</code> directory to <code>drlvm.properties</code>.
                </p>
                <pre>$ cp drlvm.properties.example drlvm.properties</pre>
                <p>
                This file contains a property definition that tells DRLVM build to
                use the class library in <code>working_classlib</code>.
                  If you want to point to another build of the class library, override
                  the given file on the command line.
                </p>
                <p>
                Double-check that the resulting properties file has
                <code>deploy.canonical.flag</code> set to <code>TRUE</code>. This value
                enables the build to create the
                <code>deploy/jre/bin</code> directory. Further building procedures require
                this directory.</p>
              </li>

              By default, the debug configuration is used. To switch to
              the release mode, do:
              </p>
              <pre>
On Windows:
> set BUILD_CFG=release
> build.bat

On Linux:
$ BUILD_CFG=release ./build.bat
</pre>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fetch the dependencies.</b><br />
            Before starting the build, fetch the
            dependencies. Note that this can take a long time.
            <pre>
On Windows:
C:...\trunk\working_vm\build>build.bat update

On Linux:
$ sh build.sh update</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Build the code.</b><br />
            To proceed with the build, run the following:
            <pre>
On Windows:
C:...\trunk\working_vm\build>build.bat

On Linux:
$ sh build.sh</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Run the acceptance tests.</b><br />
            To complete the operation, run the following acceptance tests:
            <pre>
On Windows:
C:...\trunk\working_vm\build>build.bat test

On Linux:
$ sh build.sh test</pre>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At this point, the DRLVM build is complete. A full JRE is in the
          <code>deploy/jre</code> subdirectory of the <code>build</code>
          directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you can run JRE with the <code>-version</code> argument
          to see its version:
        </p>

        <pre>
$ cd deploy/jre/bin
$ ./java -version

          <b>Class library developers</b> can work with DRLVM or install
          another compatible VM. For example, you can use the

          To install the VM, follow the instructions that accompany that VM.
          You can expand the class library code over the top of the Harmony directory (so that the 'jdk'
          directories line-up)
