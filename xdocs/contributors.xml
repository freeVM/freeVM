      If you would like to contribute to Harmony, please see the
      <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a> list to find areas where you can contribute.
      If there is nothing in there that suits your interest, but you still have
      ideas, please feel free to suggest them on

          <strong>Apache Harmony Developers</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation,
          or resources to the Apache Harmony Project. A developer that makes sustained,
          welcome contributions to the project for over six months is usually
          invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of such
          invitations depends on many factors.

        <dt>
          <strong>Apache Harmony Committers</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          The group of volunteers who are responsible for the technical
          aspects of the Apache Harmony Project. This group has
          write access to the appropriate source repositories and these
          volunteers may cast binding votes on any technical discussion.

          <p>
            Membership as a Committer is by invitation only and must
            be approved by consensus of the active Apache PMC members.
            A Committer is considered inactive by their own declaration or by
            not contributing in any form to the project for over six months.
            An inactive member can become active again by reversing whichever
            condition made them inactive (<em>i.e.</em>, by reversing their
            earlier declaration or by once again contributing toward the
            project's work). Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of
            all the active PMC members (except the member in question if they
            are a PMC member).

        <dd>
          The group of volunteers who are responsible for managing the Apache
          Harmony Project. This includes deciding what is distributed
          as products of the Project, maintaining the
          Project's shared resources, speaking on behalf of the Project,
          resolving license disputes regarding Apache products, nominating
          new PMC members or committers, and establishing these guidelines.

          <p>
            Membership in the Apache PMC is by invitation only and must
            be approved by consensus of the active Apache PMC members.
            A PMC member is considered inactive by their own declaration or by
            not contributing in any form to the project for over six months.
            An inactive member can become active again by reversing whichever
            condition made them inactive (<em>i.e.</em>, by reversing their
            earlier declaration or by once again contributing toward the
            project's work). Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of
            all the active PMC members other than the member in question.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is that every committer willing and interested in the day-to-day
            oversight and management of the project will be invited at the right time
            to join the PMC. Our goal is 100% of the committers on the PMC.
