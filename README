freeVM Java / JVM compatible system


This project is a continuation of the Apache Harmony project but is not
affiliated with the Apache Software Foundation.

The basis of this git repository has been converted from the Apache Harmony SVN
repository at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony and was completed October
2013.

The freeVM repository was converted by Adaptive Alchemy, LLC. Adaptive Alchemy
is sponsoring freeVM as continued development of the Apache Harmony code base. 
Adaptive Alchemy, LLC makes no warranties of any kind about this code base and
does not claim it suitable for any particular purpose.

Please see the svn-import directory for information on the conversion process we
used.

Feel free to contribute.  The only thing is we intend to keep this project a
"clean room" implementation, licensed under the Apache Software License. So no
code from OpenJDK or anything else GPL'd or otherwise incompatible with the ASF
license. If you have worked for Oracle on their Java products or have looked at
any of the OpenJDK code, sorry, we cannot accept your contributions - other than
perhaps fixing build files and such.
